       "      <td>May I first convey to our President the congratulations of the Albanian delegation on his election to the Presidency of the twentyfifth session of the General Assembly    In taking up the work on the agenda of the twenty fifth session of the General Assembly  which is being held on the eve of the twentyfifth anniversary of the coming into force of the Charter of the United Nations  the peaceloving Member States would have wished to be in a position to present on this occasion some picture of positive and satisfactory activity on the part of the United Nations  The Albanian delegation  for its part  would have taken great pleasure in drawing up such a balance sheet of activities covering a quarter of a century  which is certainly no short period in the life of an international organization  Unfortunately  this is not the situation  Created on the day after victory had been achieved over the Powers of the Rome BerlinTokyo Axis and conceived in the spirit of the principles which predominated in the war of the antiFascist coalition  the Organization awakened in the whole of progressive humanity the hope that it would serve as an important factor in creating better international conditions in order to favor the cause of freedom  peace and world security  But its activities and a number of events which occurred in the world arena during that period disappointed the hopes of peoples  The United Nations  far from having contributed  as required by the fundamental provisions of the Charter  to the consolidation of international peace and security and the liberation struggle of peoples  has on the contrary  under the diktat of the imperialist powers  the United States of America foremost among them  embarked on a path diametrically opposed to those principles  and has served as an instrument favoring their policy of pillage  oppression and aggression against peaceloving peoples and countries    The utilization of the United Nations to serve this policy has resulted in the Organization not only not having been able to stay the hand of those committing aggression in many parts of the world  but having frequently helped the aggressors  its activity in this direction going so far  moreover  that under the flag of the United Nations there have been perpetrated some of the most barbarous aggressions experienced since the end of the Second World War  such as  among others  the armed aggressions in Korea and in the Congo    The whole of progressive mankind recalls with admiration the heroic struggle which  under the direction of the great Stalin  the Soviet Union waged  in cooperation with the AngloAmerican coalition  to defend the peaceful peoples and countries against Hitlerite Germany  The historic and decisive victories of the Red Army over the Nazi hordes and the great role played by the Soviet Union during the Second World War aroused great enthusiasm among peoples and awakened in them the hope for a better future  They followed with great interest and with particular joy the unflinching struggle which was waged by the Leninist Soviet Union in the world arena  as well as by its authentic representatives here in this Organization  in order to defend their vital interests and to sustain their legitimate struggle for liberation from the imperialist  colonialist and racist yoke  But following the usurpation of power in that country by the Khrushchev clique  the situation changed completely  and the struggle of the Soviet Union against American imperialism and its allies was replaced by the holy alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States against the peaceloving and freedomloving peoples and countries  It is thus that  so far as the United Nations is concerned  it has become a center of bargaining  maneuvering and underhand manipulations on the part of the American imperialists and the Soviet socialimperialists  designed to lull the vigilance of peoples and to disguise as best they can their policy of world hegemony    All this has had well known consequences for the United Nations  which have been particularly damaging to its authority and its ability to play the part which is incumbent upon it under the Charter  But  at the same time  this negative activity has helped peoples to realize better the nature of the two imperialist Powers and what can be expected from the United Nations in the present circumstances where it is being manipulated by those two Powers  It has  in particular  become obvious to them that all the initiatives and proposals of American governing circles and of Moscow revisionists in connexion with disarmament and all the agreements which they seek to impose on other States in this field  with respect to both conventional armaments and nuclear armaments  are designed solely to disarm peaceloving countries and to ensure for themselves the nuclear monopoly and the largest possible quantity of armaments of all sorts in order to subjugate peoples and to enslave the world which they wish to divide between them  Peoples are becoming more aware than ever that the only way for them to break free from every imperialist  colonialist and racist yoke is through armed struggle and trust in their own strength  while at the same time enjoying the solidarity and the support of all other freedomloving peoples and countries    One of the undeniable proofs that the United Nations has embarked on the road of violating the principles and spirit of the Charter is the withholding for  years of the legitimate rights of the People s Republic of China in this Organization  a circumstance which not only has brought about an abnormal situation without precedent in this Organization and constituted a severe blow to its prestige  but also has at the same time affected its capacity regarding the contribution which it should make to the settlement of the important problems of our time  none of which  as we well know  can be given a real solution without the participation of the great socialist China of  million people    Undoubtedly  such a state of affairs in this Organization does not discourage the Member States who espouse the fundamental principles of the Charter  On the contrary  trusting in their own strength and their own possibilities and encouraged by the development and the victories of the liberation struggle waged by peoples in all continents  they will redouble their efforts and cooperate more closely in order to wage a more effective battle against the policy of diktat and force which has been practiced by the two great imperialist Powers here in the United Nations or elsewhere in the world    The liberation movement at the world level against the imperialist and colonialist Powers is at present making new strides  The peoples have reacted to the policy of oppression and domination practiced by the imperialist Powers and their aggressions and plots  by strengthening their just struggle for independence and freedom and joining the ranks of the armed struggle against the aggressors  This is shown by the struggle of the heroic peoples of VietNam  Laos  Cambodia and other countries of IndoChina  the straggle of the people of Korea and other peoples of the Far East against the United States imperialists  their allies and their tools  the struggle of the valiant Palestinians and other Arab peoples against imperialistZionist aggression  the struggle of the peoples of Oman and Dhofar and the peoples of the Arabian Gulf to free themselves from the colonial yoke  the resistance of the peoples of Eastern Europe against the domination of the new imperialists of the Kremlin  the struggle of the African peoples of Mozambique  Angola  Guinea  Bissau   Namibia  Southern Rhodesia and South Africa against the colonial Powers  the settlers and their racist tools  the struggle of the people of Puerto Rico to free themselves from the imperialist yoke of the United States  as well as all those struggles that are being waged by peoples in various parts of the world  including that of the American people in the very citadel of imperialism  The imperialist Powers and their allies are suffering defeat after defeat  Powerful blows have been struck against them everywhere by the peoples that are struggling for their national independence  for their freedom and for their sacred and inalienable right to be masters of their own destiny    Panicstricken at the impetuous growth of the revolutionary struggle for the liberation of peoples and assailed by multiple internal and external difficulties  the two socalled superPowers  American imperialism and Soviet socialimperialism  which are at the head of all reactionary forces  are striving by all means in their power to face up to this desperate situation and to accelerate the implementation of their aggressive and warlike plans against peaceloving peoples and countries  These two Powers have during this period intensified their collusion and their criminal activities  using deceit and demagogy as well as various forms of pressure  force and armed aggression    Although split by numerous contradictions deriving from their imperialist nature  each trying to undermine the other and to evict the other from its political  economic and strategic positions  these two superPowers have a common hatred for the freedom of peoples and the socialist revolution  It is on that basis that rest their cooperation and their aggressive activities  their plans and their plots  which extend to all continents in conformity with their global counterrevolutionary strategy  which is designed to divide and dominate the world  The Glasborough policy is pursued uninterruptedly  and AmericanSoviet collusion has taken fresh steps forward  Under the guise of peaceful slogans for the  peaceful settlement  of conflicts which have been brought about precisely by the aggressions which they themselves have perpetrated or directed  for European  Asian or international  security  which is in fact nothing but the security of the imperialist order for disarmament  for  internationalism  which presupposes  limited sovereignty   or more exactly the subjugation of peoples and nations  as well as other slogans  they plot and they coordinate their positions and their activities regarding various problems which affect the interests of mankind as a whole  Using such slogans  they are hatching plans and trying to impose socalled peaceful settlements by means of which they are trying to repress the liberation struggle waged by peoples  they are concluding treaties which are both fraudulent and enslaving and they are trying to conclude new aggressive pacts which will be added to the pacts  blocs and military bases that are now in existence  they are exerting pressure of all sorts on the freedomloving peoples and countries that dare to resist them  they are carrying on the arms race and the preparations for a new war  they indulge in nuclear blackmail and fresh acts of aggression    In that connexion we can cite  simultaneously with the secret negotiations of the two Powers through diplomatic channels  the long meetings of their representatives in Helsinki and later in Vienna  meetings which certainly are not limited to the question of the  limitation of strategic arms   the socalled Rogers plan for a  peaceful settlement  of the Middle East problem  a plan which is the result of the American Soviet plot designed to stifle the legitimate liberation struggle of the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples  which is at the origin of the bloody events which have taken place recently in Jordan  Of a similar nature are the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on IndoChina and the meetings organized in Moscow and elsewhere with representatives of the reactionary regimes in Asia to bring about a  peaceful settlement  of that problem a settlement which they believe will lead to the capitulation of the peoples of VietNam  Laos and Cambodia the travels of high emissaries of those two Powers in Asia and their efforts to create there new aggressive pacts in accordance with the Brezhnev plan for the  collective security of Asia  and the Nixon plan to pit Asiatics against Asiatics  plans which have been concerted between those two Powers and are designed first and foremost to create a circle of fire around the People s Republic of China  In the same category we should mention the enslaving SovietCzechoslovak treaty as well as the MoscowBonn treaty  which among other things tramples under foot the sovereign rights of the German people of the Democratic Republic of Germany and which  together with the SovietAmerican project on socalled European security  relates to the spheres of influence of the two Powers in Europe and their rearguard activities on that continent in order to implement their counterrevolutionary plans in Asia  Africa and elsewhere    In order to bring about this great antipopular conspiracy  the American and Soviet imperialists are applying a series of political  economic and military measures  such as intensifying the imperialist American aggression in Laos and the new aggression against Cambodia  plots and wiles designed to divide the Arab peoples and countries and plunge them into bloody and fratricidal conflict and to repress by all means possible  including armed force  the legitimate struggle of the heroic people of Palestine  Of a similar nature also are the threats and the measures taken by the Soviet revisionists against the peoples of Eastern European countries  including the military maneuvers of Soviet occupation forces in Czechoslovakia  carried out last August to intimidate the people on the eve of the second anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia    Thus the two Powers stop at nothing to realize their imperialist plans to stifle the revolutionary struggle of peaceloving peoples and countries  to establish their domination of the world and to arrogate to themselves the role of international police in order to decide in their own good time the fate of humanity    However  those are castles in the air  The wheel of history cannot be turned backwards  The era when the fate of peoples and of small countries was decided by the great imperialist Powers has gone for ever  The more the imperialists intensify their aggressive activities  the more the peoples strengthen their own struggle and the more the peoples strengthen their own struggle and the more closely they become united in the vast front of the armed struggle against the common enemy  Never will the peoples renounce their legitimate struggle to win back their vital rights  Despite temporary vicissitudes  their struggle is on the whole increasing and being strengthened and it appears now more than  ever before that a storm of liberation is breaking throughout Asia  Africa and elsewhere  a storm which will completely annihilate  in spite of underhanded maneuvers and repressions  imperialist and colonialist domination in whatever form it may exist    A recent example which is the best illustration of what awaits the American imperialists and their policy of intervention and war is the armed aggression they perpetrated against Cambodia last March  immediately after the coup d etat which they plotted in that country  Faced with an impasse because of the blows meted out in the struggle of the VietNamese people  the American aggressors sent their troops to Cambodia in order to implement there the  Nixon doctrine   which is designed to pit IndoChinese against IndoChinese  But this aggression  far from leading to the expected results  immediately met with the armed resistance of the people of Cambodia and the military solidarity of their VietNamese and Laotian brothers  powerfully supported by the great Chinese people as well as by the other peoples of Asia  It aroused energetic opposition on the part of peoples throughout the world  including the American people  Instead of stifling the liberation struggle of the VietNamese people  the aggression against Cambodia has spread throughout IndoChina the fire of the liberation and revolutionary struggle and has opened an even wider and deeper abyss  where American imperialism will finally be engulfed without any hope of being rescued    The success gained by the Cambodian people  under the leadership of the United Front of Cambodia  presided over by the Head of State  Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  in liberating a large part of the national territory from the aggressors and their lackeys  and the solidarity and new consolidation of the unity of the peoples of Cambodia  VietNam  Laos  the People s Republic of China  and the Democratic People s Republic of Korea  as well as of other revolutionary peoples in Asia  constitute a harsh blow to American imperialism  its collaborators and its lackeys    The American aggression against Cambodia is at the same time further proof of the collusion  at the expense of the people  of American imperialism with the revisionists of Moscow  the latter having adopted for this occasion an attitude similar to that of the American Government towards their aggression in Czechoslovakia  In particular  their refusal to recognize the Government of the United Front of Cambodia and the fact that they maintain normal diplomatic relations with the Lon Nol clique  an instrument of American imperialism supported by the puppets in Saigon and Seoul and even by the riffraff of Chiang Kaishek  as well as by international reaction as a whole  have once again revealed to world public opinion the true way with the camp of imperialism and reaction    The events of the current year in Cambodia and throughout IndoChina are of great importance for the IndoChinese peoples  which not only now have fresh proof of the obstinacy of American imperialism in carrying out acts of aggression and extending the war  but also now are in a better position to decide who is sincerely against the Yankee invader and who is with him  what the Soviet socialimperialists are and what great socialist China represents for them  Thus they realize once again that armed struggle is the only way to become free of the American aggressors    Despite the intensification of the efforts of the American imperialists  backed up by the Soviet revisionists  the valiant people of VietNam has thwarted all the plans and dangerous subterfuges designed to bring about its capitulation  Throughout South VietNam the people and its popular liberation army have taken up arms and struck crushing blows against the American aggressors  without giving them a moment of respite even in their military camps and bases  such as Da Nang  Ben Tre  Hue  the outskirts of Saigon and other parts of the country  The VietNamese people and its armed forces have  through their brilliant victories  tied down the American imperialists and their Saigon tools on the battlefield  These victories have shown undeniably that the efforts of the Yankee aggressors to escape inevitable defeat by extending the war have brought them only further irreparable reversals  The long revolutionary struggle has tempered the VietNamese people and has made it invincible  and by its determined and heroic struggle it will undoubtedly deal ever more crushing blows at American imperialism until it is completely defeated    The armed struggle for the national wellbeing of the peoples  of VietNam  Laos and Cambodia is constantly developing and being reinforced  it is now in a new stage  All the criminal plots which the American and Soviet imperialists have hatched in order to bring about a socalled peaceful settlement in IndoChina are doomed to complete failure  American imperialism is surrounded and defeated on all fronts  It is bound to be beaten    A typical case which shows the ferocity of the great AmericanSoviet conspiracy and the method of combining the most diverse means of action on the part of these imperialist Powers in order to carry out their policy of aggression and hegemony is the tragic and serious situation which prevails at the present time in the Near East  Concerned with implementing at all costs their common plan of sad repute baptized the Rogers plan designed to liquidate the Palestinian question and to divide the Arab peoples  to legalize and to reward the imperialistIsraeli aggression and to assure their imperialist interests in that area  the United States and the revisionist Soviet Union have plotted and put into effect the criminal collusion designed to stifle the Palestinian liberation movement through the reactionary regime of Jordan  thus trying to implement in the Near East the Nixon doctrine aimed at pitting Asians against Asians  Thus Jordanian reaction  serving American imperialism and Zionism  has used fire and sword  cannons  tanks and aviation against the heroic Palestinian fighters  Barbarous mass massacres have been perpetrated against the Palestinian population in Amman and elsewhere  At the same time  American imperialism  by statements from Nixon  Laird and other leaders  threatens to intervene in the internal affairs of the Arab countries and also threatens intervention by its Sixth Fleet  thus trying  as always  to play the role of international policeman to oppress peoples and suppress liberation struggles  to defend those cliques which are in their pockets  to defend their rapacious interests and to enslave peoples    American imperialism and world reaction consider as unfair the fraternal assistance given by Syria and Iraq to their Arab brothers who are struggling for a just cause  for their common cause  According to their logic they have the right and the freedom to intervene in all countries  everywhere  they can utilize tanks  cannons  and their war fleets to oppress and exploit the peoples of other countries  whereas Syria and Iraq are not entitled to come to the aid of their brothers    A wave of indignation and resentment has been unleashed throughout the progressive world  Quite rightly  the conscience of the Arab peoples has revolted against the treachery of the ruling clique in Jordan  And the world wonders  Why are tanks and bullets being used against the Palestinians  Is it because they are struggling for their liberty  for independence and for their sacred land    The peoples of all continents  profoundly indignant  are raising their voices in protest against the American imperialists and the Soviet socio imperialists  they are crying   Hands off the Palestinian people  Jordan  Syria and the other Arab countries     It is quite clear that the Palestinians are not obeying the  Rogers plan   They know full well that the American plan which is based on the Security Council resolution of  November  which  as we know  is itself the result of bargaining in the corridors between the Americans and the Soviets is designed  inter alia  to impose the elimination of the Palestinian question and the recognition of Israel s right to annex part of the territories which it invaded following its aggression of  June   This plan is also designed to reward the Zionist aggression by guaranteeing the existence of the State of Israel  which has taken over Arab territories which were also conquered by aggression  and also by recognizing other rights  Still worse  the two  superPowers  want to use the new ceasefire to continue the maneuvers and machinations which they have engaged in for the past three years in order once again to apply the tactics used by the imperialist powers after the Israeli aggression of   with the aim of putting off for ever the fulfillment of the sacred cause of the Arabs and thus making a fait accompli out of Israel s new occupation of their territories    No  the Arab people will never accept the United StatesSoviet diktat  which is designed to bring about their recapitulation  The Palestinian people and the other Arab peoples have rejected this plot  The efforts of the United States imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are in vain  The Arab peoples have a long experience  and they well know the Israeli aggressors and their masters  Never will they allow the two foreign Powers to decide their fate  whatever be their machinations and their sharing of roles  one presenting itself as the author of the criminal plan and the other giving that plan its support    The Arab peoples know full well that any proposal by the United States of America  which incited and assisted Israel to unleash aggression three years ago and which continues to provide Israel with armaments and encourages it to pursue its aggression and provocation  is designed simply to serve the imperialist interests of that Power in the area of the Near East  which is of great strategic importance and is rich in petroleum deposits  as well as the interests of Israel  its instrument  It is obvious and no one could deny it that without the assistance and support of the United States Israel would never have been in a position to initiate the aggression of June   and even less to continue to occupy the Arab territories    With regard to the Soviet revisionists  whatever mask they may put on  the Arab peoples know their faces  especially since the AmericanIsraeli aggression  and they are convinced that what they are interested in is penetrating into the Near East and the Mediterranean Basin and creating conditions favorable for their expansion in that area    The leader of the Albanian people  Comrade Enver Hoxha  referring to this problem in his statement of  September to the electors of Tirana  said  among other things   In the final analysis  the glorious revolutionary Arab peoples will not have the wool pulled over their eyes by the false friendship of Soviet social imperialism  which has taken advantage of their temporary difficulties to occupy their ports and their seas and to stifle their just liberation struggle against the Fascist Zionists and the United States imperialists  The two aggressive imperialist Powers are interested in planting their roots deep in the Near East and in ensuring that they have economic  political and military bases in the countries of the area  they want to oppress the peoples of those countries  lulling them with words  demoralizing them and corrupting them in order  finally  by the use of those bases  to go even further and invade Africa  Asia and other regions  starting colonial wars and plundering various continents   The Albanian people love the Arab peoples  because they are their brothers and their friends in good times and in bad  At this time of revolutionary and liberation struggles  we are at their side constantly  we have supported them and will continue to support them with all the means at our disposal  We have confidence in the triumph of the just cause for which they are fighting  But  in order to win an early victory over the common enemy  a unity that is hard as steel must be forged among all the Arab peoples in the armed struggle  The Zionists  the United States imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are seeking to divide the Arab peoples  to disarm them  to impose on them a peace that will be not theirs but their enemies   The arms that have been supplied to them are controlled by the Soviets  They have not been made available for the sacred Arab cause  but they are being used precisely to deceive the Arabs  to tie their hands and send them to the slaughterhouse  The  Rogers plan  of ill repute could more accurately be called the  RogersGromyko plan   The Arab peoples will certainly never fall into the terrible trap of that plan  The SovietUnited States armies can  by recourse to various insidious means  succeed in establishing themselves on both sides of the Suez Canal  in which case one may wonder what purpose the hardware supplied to the Arabs by the Soviets would serve  They have not heroically driven one imperialist from the Canal only to see it occupied now by two others   The clamoring of Day an are in harmony with the secret maneuvers of the Soviet revisionists  but the crackling of the heroic guns of the Arab Palestinian brothers is the most glorious reply  which will put down this great conspiracy of their enemies  Therefore  by all possible means  we must resolutely assist the partisan struggle of the Palestinians  a struggle that is now in the forefront of the more general battle which must be waged by Arab peoples on all fronts  Our Arab brothers will succeed in raising high the banner of the liberation struggle against the imperialists and Zionists  They will reduce to nothing the plans of the Soviet revisionists and all the provocations organized by the agencies of the CIA which are conspiring against the liberation struggle of the people of Palestine and all the Arab peoples     The Arab peoples have great revolutionary traditions and are known for their bravery and their liberation struggles  They know that they are not fighting against the Israeli aggressors only  but also against the two imperialist Powers which are mainly responsible for the situation in the Near East and  therefore  they will not allow themselves to fall into the traps of those Powers    The events of recent days in Jordan have confirmed that  as the leader of the Albanian people  Comrade Enver Hoxha  indicated in his statement of  September  Soviet socialimperialism is pursuing aims that have nothing in common with the interests of the Arab peoples  As on other occasions  they are not at all concerned with the fate of the Arab peoples  their sole aim is to consolidate their imperialist positions  In this particular case  the Soviet revisionist leaders  replying to Nixon s appeal to bring in Moscow s fire brigade to snuff out the revolutionary struggle of the Palestinians and other Arab peoples  to subjugate and enslave them  hastened to assume the role of firemen  Through their official declarations and propaganda organs  they came to the defense of the clique in power in Jordan  threatening the Palestinians with the slogan  Violence leads to violence   and addressing appeals to them and other Arab peoples asking them to give up their struggle  All those facts have served to make even more obvious to the Arab peoples the perfidious role being played by the social imperialists of Moscow and the real aims of the United StatesSoviet plan for the Near East    The Palestinians consider Jordan as their second homeland  They are not the cause of disruption in Jordan  rather  the fault lies with the reactionary regime in Jordan and King Hussein  who is in the service of United States imperialism and the  Rogers plan   On the contrary  the Palestinians in Jordan are the healthiest element in the common struggle to annihilate the common enemy    The Albanian people is profoundly indignant  strongly condemns those criminal acts and supports the heroic struggle of the Palestinians who are fighting for their sacred rights  We are convinced that  thanks to their resolute struggle and the strengthening of their unity in combat  and enjoying the support of their true friends  of all freedomloving peoples  they will expose the plots of their enemies and gain final victory over the aggressors    In the dealings between the United States and the Soviet Union  an important place is held also by the socalled question of the European security conference  proposed last year by the Kremlin leaders through their instrument of aggression  the Warsaw Treaty  There have been signs of intense activity this year  at the instigation of the two Powers  In accordance with their strategy to consolidate and subsequently extend their domination in Europe and carrying out their aggressive plans in other areas  United States and Soviet imperialists are particularly concerned with ensuring the success of that project  The Soviet revisionists in particular are showing special haste  which can be explained by their internal difficulties  the ever growing resistance of the countries of Eastern Europe to their policy of intervention and domination  by their plans and preparations for aggression directed towards Asia against the People s Republic of China  Of course the United States and its West em allies  particularly the Federal Republic of Germany  have not failed to do everything in their power to exploit this haste displayed by the Soviet revisionist leadership  in order to obtain the largest possible number of concessions on the German problem and that of West Berlin  as well as to ensure their economic  political and cultural penetration into the countries of Eastern Europe    Confronted by the insurmountable difficulties relating to the contradictions existing on many problems between the United States imperialists and the Soviet social imperialists as well as between them and the other European States  the two so called superPowers  in order to find a way out and mislead public opinion  have hit on the following formula to serve as a guiding principle for any agreement to be concluded in this framework   renunciation of the use of force in relations among the States of Europe   That misleading formula is designed in fact to give them something to cling to as they conclude these agreements  It was on the basis of that formula that the negotiations took place between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and Poland  as well as the long negotiations  of paramount importance  between the Soviet Union and West Germany    In all those activities the step which has had the greatest impact is the SovietWest German Treaty signed on  August last in Moscow  Intense propaganda attended the signing of that Treaty which was designed to present it as a historic event that would so they said bring peace to Europe and the integrity of its borders  Of course  such a campaign  regardless of the means used  could deceive only the naive  The peoples of Europe  who have had great experience  cannot be taken in by empty rhetoric  In particular  the propaganda statements of the Soviet and American leaders  and their supporters  cannot fail to recall the vast deceitful campaigns which accompanied the various stages of the plotting and compromises of the Western Powers with Hitlerian militarism  especially as regards the Munich Agreement of September     The Moscow Treaty is in fact no solution to the German problem  Indeed it is an open violation of the decisions on that problem adopted by the Allied Powers during the war  and of the oft renewed promises of the Soviet revisionist leadership to conclude a peace treaty with the two German States  or simply with the German Democratic Republic  and to defend the interests and sovereign rights of the latter  The Soviet revisionists have trampled under foot their commitments and their obligations  and thus committed a serious crime against the German people  against the German Democratic Republic  against peace and security in Europe and in the entire world  They have therefore assumed a heavy responsibility    The Moscow Treaty is in fact formal recognition of the entry of conquered Germany into the community of States  without their having signed a peace treaty  In the SovietGerman Treaty  apart from a few equivocal and questionable terms  there is no reference to recognition of borders between the two German States and the OderNeisse line dividing Poland and the German Democratic Republic as final and unchangeable borders  nor is there recognition by the Federal Republic of Germany of the German Democratic Republic as an independent  sovereign State fully enjoying all international rights  Even more important  the Chancellor of West Germany and the other leaders in Bonn have stated on more than one occasion  both before and after the signing of the Treaty  that they will never give up the idea of the reunification of the German nation  which to them means annexation of the German Democratic Republic  That position is again confirmed in the documents annexed to the Treaty  The Bonn Government thus is endeavoring to make the most out of this situation and to gain time in order to prepare to attain its  expansionist objectives in the most favorable circumstances  Thus  the Soviet revisionists have considered and used the German Democratic Republic as a bargaining counter in their dealings with the revengeseekers in Bonn  who still claim they have the right to speak and act on behalf of all of Germany  and there they are supported by the great Western Powers    As for the provisions of the Treaty concerning the renunciation of the use of force or the inviolability of borders  not only does this not mean that the borders are in fact unchangeable  but the people of Europe know full well the value of such commitments on the part of the German revengeseekers  for the memory of Hitler s nonaggression pacts with European States is still very fresh in their minds    Therefore  from all points of view  the Moscow Treaty undeniably provides Bonn s leaders with something to fall back on  It encourages their expansionist and revengeseeking plans and is at the same time a serious blow to the German Democratic Republic and all progressive peaceloving forces in Germany    No one can deny that  He creation of the German Democratic Republic was a great victory not only for the German people but for all the peoples of Europe  or that it is closely connected with peace and security in Europe  The strengthening of the German Democratic Republic and its recognition by all the States of Europe  on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality  are in the interest of their security  and are an essential condition for the settlement of the German problem and a sound basis for any sincere attempt to place the German people on the road to peace and democracy  cooperation  and friendship with all other European peoples  The agreement between the Soviet Union and West Germany is a dangerous step in the opposite direction  It cannot fail to be condemned  by all peace and freedomloving countries and peoples in Europe    It is obvious that the Moscow Treaty is first and foremost the result of bargaining between United States and Soviet imperialists  within the framework of the plans for their global strategy in Europe and other continents  But that Treaty is at the same time an agreement between two new imperialist Powers  Soviet social imperialism and West German militarism  and  as such  it is a serious threat not only to the European continent but also to other areas of the world which are the object of United StatesSoviet plans of aggression  Thus the leaders in Moscow have joined successive Governments in Washington in raising West Germany to the level of a main shock force  a principal partner of the two Powers in putting into effect their counterrevolutionary plans and their plans to subjugate all freedomloving peoples and countries  How can we fail on this occasion to remind the Assembly that similar plans were part of the policy of the Western Powers toward Hitler s Germany  but that proved very costly to them  for Hitler s Germany eventually turned on them    The MoscowBonn Treaty is undeniably a new link in the series of plots between the Soviets and the Americans against the world s peoples  and the serious threat entailed in this cannot escape the attention of any Government which is sincerely concerned with the vital interests of its people  national security and independence and world peace    The Albanian Government has always been in sympathy with the justified concern of the European States which are sincerely interested in security and peace in Europe and in the search for appropriate ways and means to normalize the situation in that continent  to deliver it from the hegemony of the two major imperialist Powers and to reject the idea of spheres of influence  to eliminate the two aggressive blocs dominated by them  and to create favorable circumstances for the development of European cooperation on the basis of respect for independence and national sovereignty  sovereign equality and mutual benefit  That is fully in line with the principles underlying our foreign policy  But  as all these States know full well  such noble objectives have nothing in common with the criminal plans of the United States and Soviet imperialists and their supporters  In all their activities  in all the pacts which they propose to conclude  in all their initiatives or proposals  including those on  European security    collective security in Asia   or  international security  presented once again  on the initiative of the Soviet revisionists  to the present session of the General Assembly the two Powers are constantly motivated by their insatiable greed to dominate and exploit the peoples of the world  by their desire to maintain and consolidate their spheres of influence in Europe and elsewhere and to have a free hand in those areas  to ensure tranquility to their rear the better to carry out all their various expansionist plans in Asia  Africa and elsewhere  using whatever means are necessary  even to the extent of threatening or using armed force    There is really no need to prove that this is the true state of affairs  It is amply borne out by all international realities and by the hotbeds of imperialist war in many areas of the world aggression in IndoChina  the Middle East  the Far East  Europe and elsewhere  the military bases of the United States and Soviet imperialists in Europe and other continents  their occupation of foreign territories  nuclear blackmail  the arms race  their fleets of warships v hich cruise in the Mediterranean  the Pacific and other seas and oceans and threaten peaceloving peoples and countries in those areas  It is all borne out  inter alia  by their criminal plans in Europe  where a particular role is assigned by them to revengeseeking Germany  their plans for Asia aimed particularly at the encirclement of the People s Republic of China and at preparation for war against that country with the cooperation of other aggressive Powers  in particular Japanese militarism  How can one claim to guarantee peace in Europe in such conditions under the aegis and protection of the two imperialist Powers  American and Soviet    One wonders against whom peace has to be guaranteed  Who is threatening the peace and security of the peoples of Europe  Can it be those of us from small  peaceloving countries  In our opinion  to be caught in such SovietAmerican traps as  European security  or  collective security in Asia  is tantamount to serving their aggressive plans or  rather  to throwing oneself to the wolves  Today more than ever before peace is indivisible  and we cannot have peace in Europe and war in Asia and elsewhere    Comrade Enver Hoxha  in his statement on the occasion of the twentyfifth anniversary of the liberation of Albania  stated in this connexion   First  the question is who should be assured and by whom  The  European security  which is sought by the Soviet revisionists and supported by the United States imperialists means security for their spheres of influence in Europe  security for their military bases and the right for their squadrons to patrol European coasts  This means that the peoples of Europe must legally and officially recognize the right of Moscow and Washington to conserve the special privileges of an imperialist and colonialist nature which they have in various countries of Europe  Such security boils down to the permanent maintenance in Europe of the status quo of Soviet American domination  to having calm ensured on that continent so that the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists have some freedom of movement and act freely in Asia  Africa and everywhere else in order to subjugate and enslave peoples  to reinforce their capitalistic system of exploitation  both at home and in their empires     We believe that international peace and security can be assured only by a resolute opposition and struggle against the two imperialist Powers  against their policy of diktat  aggression and war  Any other way would only be grist to the mill of those two Powers  which envisage the enslavement of Europe and the world    We are convinced that no matter what efforts are made by the American and Soviet imperialists and their collaborators  they will never have the tranquility they seek in Europe  They will run more and more into their own contradictions  and the peoples of Europe will not accept their hegemony in any guise  They will never allow them to pit Europe against Asia  and they will never allow themselves to be cannon fodder for the realization of the criminal plans of the two Powers    We are well aware that peaceloving Member States condemn the aggressive policies of the two imperialist Powers  their collusion at the expense of the cause of peaceloving peoples and countries  their monstrous plans to redivide and dominate the world  We have constantly admired the courageous and just struggle being waged by many countries  here in the United Nations and outside it  against this grand conspiracy of the two Powers  But the present international situation requires of all Member States faithful to the principles of the independence and equality of States great and small and respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity that they intensify their struggle still further and unite their efforts against AmericanSoviet imperialism and collusion and their desire to impose their diktat here  That is in the higher interests of international peace and security  which are seriously threatened by the aggressive policy of the American Soviet coalition  That is what is required for the lofty interests of the peoples who are fighting against imperialism  colonialism and reaction    Many States have fought unceasingly to do away with the unprecedented anomaly which exists in this Organization as a result of the violation of the lawful rights of the People s Republic of China and the usurpation of its place here by a clique of renegades in the service of American imperialism  Nevertheless  that scandalous and intolerable situation continues today because of the hostile and aggressive policy of the United States against great socialist China and its manipulation of the United Nations    At this session Albania and fourteen other countries have once again place on the Assembly s agenda the question of restoring the lawful rights of the Peoples s Republic of China in the United Nations   We have done so not only because there is a flagrant and gross violation of the Charter  which affects the sovereign rights of a founding Member State of the United Nations and permanent member of the Security Council  but also because the elimination of this abnormal  unprecedented situation is an urgent necessity for the United Nations if it is desired to take steps towards its recovery and to put it in a position to accomplish its tasks under the Charter  It is quite clear that without the People s Republic of China  given its authority  its great international role and its tremendous potential  this Organization cannot be in a position to make an effective contribution to the settlement of the important problems of our time    The People s Republic of China is a great and powerful socialist State that has had tremendous success in all areas and enjoys incomparable international prestige and authority  The dazzling victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution which thwarted the plots of the imperialists and revisionists and took control inside the Chinese citadel is a living testimony of the invincible force of the great Chinese people and guaranteed the great role which powerful socialist China now undeniably plays in the destinies of the peoples of the world    The People s Republic of China has become today a great and impregnable fortress in the liberation struggle of the peoples against imperialism  colonialism and reaction  It is the unshakable rampart of all progressive mankind    We consider that the position taken by the General Assembly on this question will prove its determination both to reject the diktat which the two great imperialist Powers seek lo exercise in the United Nations and to embark on a course in conformity with the aspirations of the peoples and the fundamental provisions of the Charter  We express the hope that the Governments of peaceloving States which constitute the xnajority here  aware of the serious situation in the United Nations  will have the courage to adopt the attitudes dictated by their convictions and the true interests of their countries and of the Organization itself    The People s Republic of Albania has constantly pursued an independent revolutionary foreign policy in accordance with the higher interests of the building and defense of our socialist homeland as well as those of the great cause of the peoples who are fighting for their freedom  their independence and their sacred right freely to determine their own future    The Albanian people have been able to defend their socialist homeland in every circumstance against all plots  threats and provocations of imperialists and revisionists  It is ever watchful and prepared at any moment to respond to anyone who dares to raise a hand against it     The Albanian people  its party and its Government  have supported and will continue strongly to support the legitimate struggle of peaceloving peoples and countries against the aggressive policy of the two imperialist Powers  their colonialist collaborators and their lackeys of all kinds  We have always stood by and shall always stand by the brother peoples of VietNam  Laos  Cambodia and the other peoples of IndoChina and Asia in their heroic struggle against the American aggressors and their allies of all kinds  We have supported and we shall continue unreservedly to support the legitimate fight of the fraternal Arab peoples against the Zionist aggressors and American and Soviet imperialists  who are mainly responsible for the present situation in the Middle East  We have vigorously supported the struggle of the peoples of European countries the peoples of Czechoslovakia  the German Democratic Republic and the other peoples of that continent as well as the peoples of other continents against the policy of domination  oppression and exploitation of the two imperialist Powers and against their counterrevolutionary  holy alliance     We are firmly convinced that the peoples of the entire world  who are fighting for a just cause on the vast antiimperialist and anticolonialist front  in ever more resolute combat solidarity  will put down all plots  aggressive plans and aggressions  no matter who may be responsible for them  and will win their final victory over their common enemies    The delegation of the People s Republic of Albania  at this session of the General Assembly  guided by the MarxistLeninist principles of our Socialist State  will continue  as in the past  together with other freedomloving peoples to make its modest contribution to the cause of freedom  independence and genuine cooperation in friendship among all the people of th  world</td>\n",
       "      <td>may I first convey to our President the congratulation of the albanian delegation on his election to the Presidency of the twentyfifth session of the General Assembly     in take up the work on the agenda of the twenty fifth session of the General Assembly   which be be hold on the eve of the twentyfifth anniversary of the come into force of the Charter of the United Nations   the peacelove Member States would have wish to be in a position to present on this occasion some picture of positive and satisfactory activity on the part of the United Nations   the albanian delegation   for its part   would have take great pleasure in draw up such a balance sheet of activity cover a quarter of a century   which be certainly no short period in the life of an international organization   unfortunately   this be not the situation   create on the day after victory have be achieve over the Powers of the Rome BerlinTokyo Axis and conceive in the spirit of the principle which predominate in the war of the antifascist coalition   the Organization awaken in the whole of progressive humanity the hope that it would serve as an important factor in create well international condition in order to favor the cause of freedom   peace and world security   but its activity and a number of event which occur in the world arena during that period disappoint the hope of people   the United Nations   far from having contribute   as require by the fundamental provision of the Charter   to the consolidation of international peace and security and the liberation struggle of people   have on the contrary   under the diktat of the imperialist power   the United States of America foremost among they   embark on a path diametrically oppose to those principle   and have serve as an instrument favor their policy of pillage   oppression and aggression against peacelove people and country     the utilization of the United Nations to serve this policy have result in the Organization not only not having be able to stay the hand of those commit aggression in many part of the world   but having frequently help the aggressor   its activity in this direction go so far   moreover   that under the flag of the United Nations there have be perpetrate some of the most barbarous aggression experience since the end of the Second World War   such as   among other   the armed aggression in Korea and in the Congo     the whole of progressive mankind recall with admiration the heroic struggle which   under the direction of the great Stalin   the Soviet Union wage   in cooperation with the AngloAmerican coalition   to defend the peaceful people and country against Hitlerite Germany   the historic and decisive victory of the Red Army over the Nazi horde and the great role play by the Soviet Union during the Second World War arouse great enthusiasm among people and awaken in they the hope for a well future   they follow with great interest and with particular joy the unflinche struggle which be wage by the Leninist Soviet Union in the world arena   as well as by its authentic representative here in this Organization   in order to defend their vital interest and to sustain their legitimate struggle for liberation from the imperialist   colonialist and racist yoke   but follow the usurpation of power in that country by the Khrushchev clique   the situation change completely   and the struggle of the Soviet Union against american imperialism and its ally be replace by the holy alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States against the peacelove and freedomlove people and country   it be thus that   so far as the United Nations be concern   it have become a center of bargaining   maneuvering and underhand manipulation on the part of the american imperialist and the soviet socialimperialist   design to lull the vigilance of people and to disguise as well they can their policy of world hegemony     all this have have well know consequence for the United Nations   which have be particularly damaging to its authority and its ability to play the part which be incumbent upon it under the Charter   but   at the same time   this negative activity have help people to realize well the nature of the two imperialist Powers and what can be expect from the United Nations in the present circumstance where it be be manipulate by those two Powers   it have   in particular   become obvious to they that all the initiative and proposal of american governing circle and of Moscow revisionist in connexion with disarmament and all the agreement which they seek to impose on other state in this field   with respect to both conventional armament and nuclear armament   be design solely to disarm peaceloving country and to ensure for themselves the nuclear monopoly and the large possible quantity of armament of all sort in order to subjugate people and to enslave the world which they wish to divide between they   Peoples be become more aware than ever that the only way for they to break free from every imperialist   colonialist and racist yoke be through armed struggle and trust in their own strength   while at the same time enjoy the solidarity and the support of all other freedomlove people and country     one of the undeniable proof that the United Nations have embark on the road of violate the principle and spirit of the Charter be the withholding for   year of the legitimate right of the People s Republic of China in this Organization   a circumstance which not only have bring about an abnormal situation without precedent in this Organization and constitute a severe blow to its prestige   but also have at the same time affect its capacity regard the contribution which it should make to the settlement of the important problem of our time   none of which   as we well know   can be give a real solution without the participation of the great socialist China of   million people     undoubtedly   such a state of affair in this Organization do not discourage the Member States who espouse the fundamental principle of the Charter   on the contrary   trust in their own strength and their own possibility and encourage by the development and the victory of the liberation struggle wage by people in all continent   they will redouble their effort and cooperate more closely in order to wage a more effective battle against the policy of diktat and force which have be practice by the two great imperialist power here in the United Nations or elsewhere in the world     the liberation movement at the world level against the imperialist and colonialist Powers be at present make new stride   the people have react to the policy of oppression and domination practice by the imperialist Powers and their aggression and plot   by strengthen their just struggle for independence and freedom and join the rank of the armed struggle against the aggressor   this be show by the struggle of the heroic people of VietNam   Laos   Cambodia and other country of IndoChina   the straggle of the people of Korea and other people of the Far East against the United States imperialist   their ally and their tool   the struggle of the valiant Palestinians and other arab people against imperialistzionist aggression   the struggle of the people of Oman and Dhofar and the people of the Arabian Gulf to free themselves from the colonial yoke   the resistance of the people of Eastern Europe against the domination of the new imperialist of the Kremlin   the struggle of the african people of Mozambique   Angola   Guinea   Bissau    Namibia   Southern Rhodesia and South Africa against the colonial Powers   the settler and their racist tool   the struggle of the people of Puerto Rico to free themselves from the imperialist yoke of the United States   as well as all those struggle that be be wage by people in various part of the world   include that of the american people in the very citadel of imperialism   the imperialist Powers and their ally be suffer defeat after defeat   powerful blow have be strike against they everywhere by the people that be struggle for their national independence   for their freedom and for their sacred and inalienable right to be master of their own destiny     Panicstricken at the impetuous growth of the revolutionary struggle for the liberation of people and assail by multiple internal and external difficulty   the two socalled superpower   american imperialism and soviet socialimperialism   which be at the head of all reactionary force   be strive you all mean in their power to face up to this desperate situation and to accelerate the implementation of their aggressive and warlike plan against peacelove people and country   these two power have during this period intensify their collusion and their criminal activity   use deceit and demagogy as well as various form of pressure   force and armed aggression     although split by numerous contradiction derive from their imperialist nature   each try to undermine the other and to evict the other from its political   economic and strategic position   these two superpower have a common hatred for the freedom of people and the socialist revolution   it be on that basis that rest their cooperation and their aggressive activity   their plan and their plot   which extend to all continent in conformity with their global counterrevolutionary strategy   which be design to divide and dominate the world   the Glasborough policy be pursue uninterruptedly   and AmericanSoviet collusion have take fresh step forward   under the guise of peaceful slogan for the   peaceful settlement   of conflict which have be bring about precisely by the aggression which they themselves have perpetrate or direct   for european   asian or international   security   which be in fact nothing but the security of the imperialist order for disarmament   for   internationalism   which presuppose   limited sovereignty    or more exactly the subjugation of people and nation   as well as other slogan   they plot and they coordinate their position and their activity regard various problem which affect the interest of mankind as a whole   use such slogan   they be hatch plan and try to impose socalled peaceful settlement by mean of which they be try to repress the liberation struggle wage by people   they be conclude treaty which be both fraudulent and enslaving and they be try to conclude new aggressive pact which will be add to the pact   bloc and military basis that be now in existence   they be exert pressure of all sort on the freedomlove people and country that dare to resist they   they be carry on the arm race and the preparation for a new war   they indulge in nuclear blackmail and fresh act of aggression     in that connexion we can cite   simultaneously with the secret negotiation of the two Powers through diplomatic channel   the long meeting of their representative in Helsinki and later in Vienna   meeting which certainly be not limit to the question of the   limitation of strategic arm    the socalle Rogers plan for a   peaceful settlement   of the Middle East problem   a plan which be the result of the american soviet plot design to stifle the legitimate liberation struggle of the palestinian people and other arab people   which be at the origin of the bloody event which have take place recently in Jordan   of a similar nature be the negotiation between the United States and the Soviet Union on IndoChina and the meeting organize in Moscow and elsewhere with representative of the reactionary regime in Asia to bring about a   peaceful settlement   of that problem a settlement which they believe will lead to the capitulation of the people of VietNam   Laos and Cambodia the travel of high emissary of those two power in Asia and their effort to create there new aggressive pact in accordance with the Brezhnev plan for the   collective security of Asia   and the Nixon plan to pit Asiatics against Asiatics   plan which have be concert between those two power and be design first and foremost to create a circle of fire around the People s Republic of China   in the same category we should mention the enslaving SovietCzechoslovak treaty as well as the MoscowBonn treaty   which among other thing trample under foot the sovereign right of the german people of the Democratic Republic of Germany and which   together with the SovietAmerican project on socalle european security   relate to the sphere of influence of the two power in Europe and their rearguard activity on that continent in order to implement their counterrevolutionary plan in Asia   Africa and elsewhere     in order to bring about this great antipopular conspiracy   the american and soviet imperialist be apply a series of political   economic and military measure   such as intensify the imperialist american aggression in Laos and the new aggression against Cambodia   plot and wile design to divide the arab people and country and plunge they into bloody and fratricidal conflict and to repress you all mean possible   include armed force   the legitimate struggle of the heroic people of Palestine   of a similar nature also be the threat and the measure take by the soviet revisionist against the people of eastern european country   include the military maneuver of soviet occupation force in Czechoslovakia   carry out last August to intimidate the people on the eve of the second anniversary of the soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia     thus the two Powers stop at nothing to realize their imperialist plan to stifle the revolutionary struggle of peacelove people and country   to establish their domination of the world and to arrogate to themselves the role of international police in order to decide in their own good time the fate of humanity     however   those be castle in the air   the wheel of history can not be turn backwards   the era when the fate of people and of small country be decide by the great imperialist power have go for ever   the more the imperialist intensify their aggressive activity   the more the people strengthen their own struggle and the more the people strengthen their own struggle and the more closely they become united in the vast front of the armed struggle against the common enemy   never will the people renounce their legitimate struggle to win back their vital right   despite temporary vicissitude   their struggle be on the whole increase and be strengthen and it appear now more than   ever before that a storm of liberation be break throughout Asia   Africa and elsewhere   a storm which will completely annihilate   in spite of underhanded maneuver and repression   imperialist and colonialist domination in whatever form it may exist     a recent example which be the good illustration of what await the american imperialist and their policy of intervention and war be the armed aggression they perpetrate against Cambodia last March   immediately after the coup d etat which they plot in that country   face with an impasse because of the blow mete out in the struggle of the vietnamese people   the american aggressor send their troop to Cambodia in order to implement there the   Nixon doctrine    which be design to pit IndoChinese against IndoChinese   but this aggression   far from lead to the expect result   immediately meet with the armed resistance of the people of Cambodia and the military solidarity of their vietnamese and laotian brother   powerfully support by the great chinese people as well as by the other people of Asia   it arouse energetic opposition on the part of people throughout the world   include the american people   instead of stifle the liberation struggle of the vietnamese people   the aggression against Cambodia have spread throughout IndoChina the fire of the liberation and revolutionary struggle and have open an even wide and deep abyss   where american imperialism will finally be engulf without any hope of be rescue     the success gain by the cambodian people   under the leadership of the United Front of Cambodia   preside over by the Head of State   Samdech Norodom Sihanouk   in liberate a large part of the national territory from the aggressor and their lackey   and the solidarity and new consolidation of the unity of the people of Cambodia   VietNam   Laos   the People s Republic of China   and the Democratic People s Republic of Korea   as well as of other revolutionary people in Asia   constitute a harsh blow to american imperialism   its collaborator and its lackey     the american aggression against Cambodia be at the same time further proof of the collusion   at the expense of the people   of american imperialism with the revisionist of Moscow   the latter having adopt for this occasion an attitude similar to that of the American Government towards their aggression in Czechoslovakia   in particular   their refusal to recognize the Government of the United Front of Cambodia and the fact that they maintain normal diplomatic relation with the Lon Nol clique   an instrument of american imperialism support by the puppet in Saigon and Seoul and even by the riffraff of Chiang Kaishek   as well as by international reaction as a whole   have once again reveal to world public opinion the true way with the camp of imperialism and reaction     the event of the current year in Cambodia and throughout IndoChina be of great importance for the indochinese people   which not only now have fresh proof of the obstinacy of american imperialism in carry out act of aggression and extend the war   but also now be in a well position to decide who be sincerely against the Yankee invader and who be with he   what the soviet socialimperialist be and what great socialist China represent for they   thus they realize once again that armed struggle be the only way to become free of the american aggressor     despite the intensification of the effort of the american imperialist   back up by the soviet revisionist   the valiant people of VietNam have thwart all the plan and dangerous subterfuge design to bring about its capitulation   throughout South VietNam the people and its popular liberation army have take up arm and strike crush blow against the american aggressor   without give they a moment of respite even in their military camp and basis   such as Da Nang   Ben Tre   Hue   the outskirt of Saigon and other part of the country   the vietnamese people and its armed force have   through their brilliant victory   tie down the american imperialist and their Saigon tool on the battlefield   these victory have show undeniably that the effort of the Yankee aggressor to escape inevitable defeat by extend the war have bring they only far irreparable reversal   the long revolutionary struggle have temper the vietnamese people and have make it invincible   and by its determined and heroic struggle it will undoubtedly deal ever more crush blow at american imperialism until it be completely defeat     the armed struggle for the national wellbeing of the people   of VietNam   Laos and Cambodia be constantly develop and be reinforce   it be now in a new stage   all the criminal plot which the american and soviet imperialist have hatch in order to bring about a socalled peaceful settlement in IndoChina be doom to complete failure   american imperialism be surround and defeat on all front   it be bind to be beat     a typical case which show the ferocity of the great AmericanSoviet conspiracy and the method of combine the most diverse mean of action on the part of these imperialist power in order to carry out their policy of aggression and hegemony be the tragic and serious situation which prevail at the present time in the Near East   concern with implement at all cost their common plan of sad repute baptize the Rogers plan design to liquidate the palestinian question and to divide the arab people   to legalize and to reward the imperialistisraeli aggression and to assure their imperialist interest in that area   the United States and the revisionist Soviet Union have plot and put into effect the criminal collusion design to stifle the palestinian liberation movement through the reactionary regime of Jordan   thus try to implement in the Near East the Nixon doctrine aim at pit Asians against Asians   thus jordanian reaction   serve american imperialism and Zionism   have use fire and sword   cannon   tank and aviation against the heroic palestinian fighter   barbarous mass massacre have be perpetrate against the palestinian population in Amman and elsewhere   at the same time   american imperialism   by statement from Nixon   Laird and other leader   threaten to intervene in the internal affair of the arab country and also threaten intervention by its Sixth Fleet   thus try   as always   to play the role of international policeman to oppress people and suppress liberation struggle   to defend those clique which be in their pocket   to defend their rapacious interest and to enslave people     american imperialism and world reaction consider as unfair the fraternal assistance give by Syria and Iraq to their arab brother who be struggle for a just cause   for their common cause   accord to their logic they have the right and the freedom to intervene in all country   everywhere   they can utilize tank   cannon   and their war fleet to oppress and exploit the people of other country   whereas Syria and Iraq be not entitle to come to the aid of their brother     a wave of indignation and resentment have be unleash throughout the progressive world   quite rightly   the conscience of the arab people have revolt against the treachery of the rule clique in Jordan   and the world wonder   why be tank and bullet be use against the Palestinians   be it because they be struggle for their liberty   for independence and for their sacred land     the people of all continent   profoundly indignant   be raise their voice in protest against the american imperialist and the soviet socio imperialist   they be cry    Hands off the palestinian people   Jordan   Syria and the other arab country      it be quite clear that the Palestinians be not obey the   Rogers plan    they know full well that the american plan which be base on the Security Council resolution of   November   which   as we know   be itself the result of bargaining in the corridor between the Americans and the Soviets be design   inter alia   to impose the elimination of the palestinian question and the recognition of Israel s right to annex part of the territory which it invade follow its aggression of   June    this plan be also design to reward the zionist aggression by guarantee the existence of the State of Israel   which have take over arab territory which be also conquer by aggression   and also by recognize other right   still bad   the two   superpower   want to use the new ceasefire to continue the maneuver and machination which they have engage in for the past three year in order once again to apply the tactic use by the imperialist power after the israeli aggression of    with the aim of put off for ever the fulfillment of the sacred cause of the Arabs and thus make a fait accompli out of Israel s new occupation of their territory     no   the arab people will never accept the United StatesSoviet diktat   which be design to bring about their recapitulation   the palestinian people and the other arab people have reject this plot   the effort of the United States imperialist and the soviet revisionist be in vain   the arab people have a long experience   and they well know the israeli aggressor and their master   never will they allow the two foreign power to decide their fate   whatever be their machination and their sharing of role   one present itself as the author of the criminal plan and the other giving that plan its support     the arab people know full well that any proposal by the United States of America   which incite and assist Israel to unleash aggression three year ago and which continue to provide Israel with armament and encourage it to pursue its aggression and provocation   be design simply to serve the imperialist interest of that power in the area of the Near East   which be of great strategic importance and be rich in petroleum deposit   as well as the interest of Israel   its instrument   it be obvious and no one could deny it that without the assistance and support of the United States Israel would never have be in a position to initiate the aggression of June    and even less to continue to occupy the arab territory     with regard to the soviet revisionist   whatever mask they may put on   the arab people know their face   especially since the AmericanIsraeli aggression   and they be convinced that what they be interested in be penetrate into the Near East and the Mediterranean Basin and create condition favorable for their expansion in that area     the leader of the albanian people   Comrade Enver Hoxha   refer to this problem in his statement of   September to the elector of Tirana   say   among other thing    in the final analysis   the glorious revolutionary arab people will not have the wool pull over their eye by the false friendship of soviet social imperialism   which have take advantage of their temporary difficulty to occupy their port and their sea and to stifle their just liberation struggle against the Fascist Zionists and the United States imperialist   the two aggressive imperialist power be interested in plant their root deep in the Near East and in ensure that they have economic   political and military basis in the country of the area   they want to oppress the people of those country   lull they with word   demoralize they and corrupt they in order   finally   by the use of those basis   to go even far and invade Africa   Asia and other region   start colonial war and plunder various continent    the albanian people love the arab people   because they be their brother and their friend in good time and in bad   at this time of revolutionary and liberation struggle   we be at their side constantly   we have support they and will continue to support they with all the mean at our disposal   we have confidence in the triumph of the just cause for which they be fight   but   in order to win an early victory over the common enemy   a unity that be hard as steel must be forge among all the arab people in the armed struggle   the Zionists   the United States imperialist and the soviet revisionist be seek to divide the arab people   to disarm they   to impose on they a peace that will be not theirs but their enemy    the arm that have be supply to they be control by the Soviets   they have not be make available for the sacred arab cause   but they be be use precisely to deceive the Arabs   to tie their hand and send they to the slaughterhouse   the   Rogers plan   of ill repute could more accurately be call the   RogersGromyko plan    the arab people will certainly never fall into the terrible trap of that plan   the SovietUnited States army can   by recourse to various insidious mean   succeed in establish themselves on both side of the Suez Canal   in which case one may wonder what purpose the hardware supply to the Arabs by the Soviets would serve   they have not heroically drive one imperialist from the Canal only to see it occupy now by two other    the clamoring of day an be in harmony with the secret maneuver of the soviet revisionist   but the crackling of the heroic gun of the arab palestinian brother be the most glorious reply   which will put down this great conspiracy of their enemy   therefore   you all possible mean   we must resolutely assist the partisan struggle of the Palestinians   a struggle that be now in the forefront of the more general battle which must be wage by arab people on all front   our arab brother will succeed in raise high the banner of the liberation struggle against the imperialist and Zionists   they will reduce to nothing the plan of the soviet revisionist and all the provocation organize by the agency of the CIA which be conspire against the liberation struggle of the people of Palestine and all the arab people      the arab people have great revolutionary tradition and be know for their bravery and their liberation struggle   they know that they be not fight against the israeli aggressor only   but also against the two imperialist power which be mainly responsible for the situation in the Near East and   therefore   they will not allow themselves to fall into the trap of those power     the event of recent day in Jordan have confirm that   as the leader of the albanian people   Comrade Enver Hoxha   indicate in his statement of   September   soviet socialimperialism be pursue aim that have nothing in common with the interest of the arab people   as on other occasion   they be not at all concerned with the fate of the arab people   their sole aim be to consolidate their imperialist position   in this particular case   the soviet revisionist leader   reply to Nixon s appeal to bring in Moscow s fire brigade to snuff out the revolutionary struggle of the Palestinians and other arab people   to subjugate and enslave they   hasten to assume the role of fireman   through their official declaration and propaganda organ   they come to the defense of the clique in power in Jordan   threaten the Palestinians with the slogan   violence lead to violence    and address appeal to they and other arab people ask they to give up their struggle   all those fact have serve to make even more obvious to the arab people the perfidious role be play by the social imperialist of Moscow and the real aim of the United StatesSoviet plan for the Near East     the Palestinians consider Jordan as their second homeland   they be not the cause of disruption in Jordan   rather   the fault lie with the reactionary regime in Jordan and King Hussein   who be in the service of United States imperialism and the   Rogers plan    on the contrary   the Palestinians in Jordan be the healthy element in the common struggle to annihilate the common enemy     the albanian people be profoundly indignant   strongly condemn those criminal act and support the heroic struggle of the Palestinians who be fight for their sacred right   we be convince that   thank to their resolute struggle and the strengthening of their unity in combat   and enjoy the support of their true friend   of all freedomlove people   they will expose the plot of their enemy and gain final victory over the aggressor     in the dealing between the United States and the Soviet Union   an important place be hold also by the socalled question of the european security conference   propose last year by the Kremlin leader through their instrument of aggression   the Warsaw Treaty   there have be sign of intense activity this year   at the instigation of the two Powers   in accordance with their strategy to consolidate and subsequently extend their domination in Europe and carry out their aggressive plan in other area   United States and soviet imperialist be particularly concerned with ensure the success of that project   the soviet revisionist in particular be show special haste   which can be explain by their internal difficulty   the ever grow resistance of the country of Eastern Europe to their policy of intervention and domination   by their plan and preparation for aggression direct towards Asia against the People s Republic of China   of course the United States and its West em ally   particularly the Federal Republic of Germany   have not fail to do everything in their power to exploit this haste display by the soviet revisionist leadership   in order to obtain the large possible number of concession on the german problem and that of West Berlin   as well as to ensure their economic   political and cultural penetration into the country of Eastern Europe     confront by the insurmountable difficulty relate to the contradiction exist on many problem between the United States imperialist and the soviet social imperialist as well as between they and the other European States   the two so call superpower   in order to find a way out and mislead public opinion   have hit on the following formula to serve as a guide principle for any agreement to be conclude in this framework    renunciation of the use of force in relation among the States of Europe    that misleading formula be design in fact to give they something to cling to as they conclude these agreement   it be on the basis of that formula that the negotiation take place between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and Poland   as well as the long negotiation   of paramount importance   between the Soviet Union and West Germany     in all those activity the step which have have the great impact be the SovietWest German Treaty sign on   August last in Moscow   intense propaganda attend the signing of that treaty which be design to present it as a historic event that would so they say bring peace to Europe and the integrity of its border   of course   such a campaign   regardless of the mean use   could deceive only the naive   the people of Europe   who have have great experience   can not be take in by empty rhetoric   in particular   the propaganda statement of the soviet and american leader   and their supporter   can not fail to recall the vast deceitful campaign which accompany the various stage of the plotting and compromise of the Western Powers with hitlerian militarism   especially as regard the Munich Agreement of September      the Moscow Treaty be in fact no solution to the german problem   indeed it be an open violation of the decision on that problem adopt by the Allied Powers during the war   and of the oft renew promise of the soviet revisionist leadership to conclude a peace treaty with the two german States   or simply with the German Democratic Republic   and to defend the interest and sovereign right of the latter   the soviet revisionist have trample under foot their commitment and their obligation   and thus commit a serious crime against the german people   against the German Democratic Republic   against peace and security in Europe and in the entire world   they have therefore assume a heavy responsibility     the Moscow Treaty be in fact formal recognition of the entry of conquer Germany into the community of States   without their having sign a peace treaty   in the SovietGerman Treaty   apart from a few equivocal and questionable term   there be no reference to recognition of border between the two german States and the OderNeisse line divide Poland and the German Democratic Republic as final and unchangeable border   nor be there recognition by the Federal Republic of Germany of the German Democratic Republic as an independent   sovereign State fully you all international right   even more important   the Chancellor of West Germany and the other leader in Bonn have state on more than one occasion   both before and after the signing of the Treaty   that they will never give up the idea of the reunification of the german nation   which to they mean annexation of the German Democratic Republic   that position be again confirm in the document annex to the Treaty   the Bonn Government thus be endeavor to make the most out of this situation and to gain time in order to prepare to attain its   expansionist objective in the most favorable circumstance   thus   the soviet revisionist have consider and use the German Democratic Republic as a bargaining counter in their dealing with the revengeseeker in Bonn   who still claim they have the right to speak and act on behalf of all of Germany   and there they be support by the great Western power     as for the provision of the Treaty concern the renunciation of the use of force or the inviolability of border   not only do this not mean that the border be in fact unchangeable   but the people of Europe know full well the value of such commitment on the part of the german revengeseeker   for the memory of Hitler s nonaggression pact with European States be still very fresh in their mind     therefore   from all point of view   the Moscow Treaty undeniably provide Bonn s leader with something to fall back on   it encourage their expansionist and revengeseeke plan and be at the same time a serious blow to the German Democratic Republic and all progressive peacelove force in Germany     no one can deny that   he creation of the German Democratic Republic be a great victory not only for the german people but for all the people of Europe   or that it be closely connect with peace and security in Europe   the strengthening of the German Democratic Republic and its recognition you all the States of Europe   on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality   be in the interest of their security   and be an essential condition for the settlement of the german problem and a sound basis for any sincere attempt to place the german people on the road to peace and democracy   cooperation   and friendship with all other european people   the agreement between the Soviet Union and West Germany be a dangerous step in the opposite direction   it can not fail to be condemn   you all peace and freedomlove country and people in Europe     it be obvious that the Moscow Treaty be first and foremost the result of bargaining between United States and Soviet imperialist   within the framework of the plan for their global strategy in Europe and other continent   but that Treaty be at the same time an agreement between two new imperialist Powers   soviet social imperialism and west german militarism   and   as such   it be a serious threat not only to the european continent but also to other area of the world which be the object of United StatesSoviet plan of aggression   thus the leader in Moscow have join successive government in Washington in raise West Germany to the level of a main shock force   a principal partner of the two power in put into effect their counterrevolutionary plan and their plan to subjugate all freedomlove people and country   how can we fail on this occasion to remind the Assembly that similar plan be part of the policy of the Western Powers toward Hitler s Germany   but that prove very costly to they   for Hitler s Germany eventually turn on they     the MoscowBonn Treaty be undeniably a new link in the series of plot between the Soviets and the Americans against the world s people   and the serious threat entail in this can not escape the attention of any government which be sincerely concerned with the vital interest of its people   national security and independence and world peace     the albanian Government have always be in sympathy with the justified concern of the European States which be sincerely interested in security and peace in Europe and in the search for appropriate way and mean to normalize the situation in that continent   to deliver it from the hegemony of the two major imperialist power and to reject the idea of sphere of influence   to eliminate the two aggressive bloc dominate by they   and to create favorable circumstance for the development of european cooperation on the basis of respect for independence and national sovereignty   sovereign equality and mutual benefit   that be fully in line with the principle underlie our foreign policy   but   as all these state know full well   such noble objective have nothing in common with the criminal plan of the United States and soviet imperialist and their supporter   in all their activity   in all the pact which they propose to conclude   in all their initiative or proposal   include those on   european security     collective security in Asia    or   international security   present once again   on the initiative of the soviet revisionist   to the present session of the General Assembly the two power be constantly motivate by their insatiable greed to dominate and exploit the people of the world   by their desire to maintain and consolidate their sphere of influence in Europe and elsewhere and to have a free hand in those area   to ensure tranquility to their rear the well to carry out all their various expansionist plan in Asia   Africa and elsewhere   use whatever mean be necessary   even to the extent of threaten or use armed force     there be really no need to prove that this be the true state of affair   it be amply bear out you all international reality and by the hotbed of imperialist war in many area of the world aggression in IndoChina   the Middle East   the Far East   Europe and elsewhere   the military basis of the United States and soviet imperialist in Europe and other continent   their occupation of foreign territory   nuclear blackmail   the arm race   their fleet of warship v hich cruise in the Mediterranean   the Pacific and other sea and ocean and threaten peacelove people and country in those area   it be all bear out   inter alia   by their criminal plan in Europe   where a particular role be assign by they to revengeseeke Germany   their plan for Asia aim particularly at the encirclement of the People s Republic of China and at preparation for war against that country with the cooperation of other aggressive Powers   in particular japanese militarism   how can one claim to guarantee peace in Europe in such condition under the aegis and protection of the two imperialist Powers   american and Soviet     One wonder against whom peace have to be guarantee   who be threaten the peace and security of the people of Europe   can it be those of we from small   peacelove country   in our opinion   to be catch in such SovietAmerican trap as   european security   or   collective security in Asia   be tantamount to serve their aggressive plan or   rather   to throw oneself to the wolf   today more than ever before peace be indivisible   and we can not have peace in Europe and war in Asia and elsewhere     Comrade Enver Hoxha   in his statement on the occasion of the twentyfifth anniversary of the liberation of Albania   state in this connexion    first   the question be who should be assure and by whom   the   european security   which be seek by the soviet revisionist and support by the United States imperialist mean security for their sphere of influence in Europe   security for their military basis and the right for their squadron to patrol european coast   this mean that the people of Europe must legally and officially recognize the right of Moscow and Washington to conserve the special privilege of an imperialist and colonialist nature which they have in various country of Europe   such security boil down to the permanent maintenance in Europe of the status quo of soviet american domination   to have calm ensure on that continent so that the soviet revisionist and american imperialist have some freedom of movement and act freely in Asia   Africa and everywhere else in order to subjugate and enslave people   to reinforce their capitalistic system of exploitation   both at home and in their empire      we believe that international peace and security can be assure only by a resolute opposition and struggle against the two imperialist Powers   against their policy of diktat   aggression and war   any other way would only be grist to the mill of those two Powers   which envisage the enslavement of Europe and the world     we be convinced that no matter what effort be make by the american and soviet imperialist and their collaborator   they will never have the tranquility they seek in Europe   they will run more and more into their own contradiction   and the people of Europe will not accept their hegemony in any guise   they will never allow they to pit Europe against Asia   and they will never allow themselves to be cannon fodder for the realization of the criminal plan of the two power     we be well aware that peacelove Member States condemn the aggressive policy of the two imperialist Powers   their collusion at the expense of the cause of peacelove people and country   their monstrous plan to redivide and dominate the world   we have constantly admire the courageous and just struggle be wage by many country   here in the United Nations and outside it   against this grand conspiracy of the two Powers   but the present international situation require of all Member States faithful to the principle of the independence and equality of States great and small and respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity that they intensify their struggle still far and unite their effort against AmericanSoviet imperialism and collusion and their desire to impose their diktat here   that be in the high interest of international peace and security   which be seriously threaten by the aggressive policy of the American Soviet coalition   that be what be require for the lofty interest of the people who be fight against imperialism   colonialism and reaction     many state have fight unceasingly to do away with the unprecedented anomaly which exist in this Organization as a result of the violation of the lawful right of the People s Republic of China and the usurpation of its place here by a clique of renegade in the service of american imperialism   nevertheless   that scandalous and intolerable situation continue today because of the hostile and aggressive policy of the United States against great socialist China and its manipulation of the United Nations     at this session Albania and fourteen other country have once again place on the Assembly s agenda the question of restore the lawful right of the Peoples s Republic of China in the United Nations    we have do so not only because there be a flagrant and gross violation of the Charter   which affect the sovereign right of a found Member State of the United Nations and permanent member of the Security Council   but also because the elimination of this abnormal   unprecedented situation be an urgent necessity for the United Nations if it be desire to take step towards its recovery and to put it in a position to accomplish its task under the Charter   it be quite clear that without the People s Republic of China   give its authority   its great international role and its tremendous potential   this Organization can not be in a position to make an effective contribution to the settlement of the important problem of our time     the People s Republic of China be a great and powerful socialist State that have have tremendous success in all area and enjoy incomparable international prestige and authority   the dazzling victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution which thwart the plot of the imperialist and revisionist and take control inside the chinese citadel be a live testimony of the invincible force of the great chinese people and guarantee the great role which powerful socialist China now undeniably play in the destiny of the people of the world     the People s Republic of China have become today a great and impregnable fortress in the liberation struggle of the people against imperialism   colonialism and reaction   it be the unshakable rampart of all progressive mankind     we consider that the position take by the General Assembly on this question will prove its determination both to reject the diktat which the two great imperialist power seek lo exercise in the United Nations and to embark on a course in conformity with the aspiration of the people and the fundamental provision of the Charter   we express the hope that the government of peacelove state which constitute the xnajority here   aware of the serious situation in the United Nations   will have the courage to adopt the attitude dictate by their conviction and the true interest of their country and of the Organization itself     the People s Republic of Albania have constantly pursue an independent revolutionary foreign policy in accordance with the high interest of the building and defense of our socialist homeland as well as those of the great cause of the people who be fight for their freedom   their independence and their sacred right freely to determine their own future     the albanian people have be able to defend their socialist homeland in every circumstance against all plot   threat and provocation of imperialist and revisionists   it be ever watchful and prepare at any moment to respond to anyone who dare to raise a hand against it      the albanian people   its party and its Government   have support and will continue strongly to support the legitimate struggle of peacelove people and country against the aggressive policy of the two imperialist Powers   their colonialist collaborator and their lackey of all kind   we have always stand by and shall always stand by the brother people of VietNam   Laos   Cambodia and the other people of IndoChina and Asia in their heroic struggle against the american aggressor and their ally of all kind   we have support and we shall continue unreservedly to support the legitimate fight of the fraternal arab people against the zionist aggressor and american and Soviet imperialist   who be mainly responsible for the present situation in the Middle East   we have vigorously support the struggle of the people of european country the people of Czechoslovakia   the German Democratic Republic and the other people of that continent as well as the people of other continent against the policy of domination   oppression and exploitation of the two imperialist power and against their counterrevolutionary   holy alliance      we be firmly convinced that the people of the entire world   who be fight for a just cause on the vast antiimperialist and anticolonialist front   in ever more resolute combat solidarity   will put down all plot   aggressive plan and aggression   no matter who may be responsible for they   and will win their final victory over their common enemy     the delegation of the People s Republic of Albania   at this session of the General Assembly   guide by the MarxistLeninist principle of our Socialist State   will continue   as in the past   together with other freedomlove people to make its modest contribution to the cause of freedom   independence and genuine cooperation in friendship among all

       "      <td>It is a fortunate coincidence that precisely at a time when the United Nations is celebrating its first twentyfive years of existence  an eminent jurist so closely linked to our Organization should have been elected to preside over the General Assembly  On behalf of the Argentine Government  it is a pleasure for me to congratulate Your Excellency  Mr  President  on this felicitous choice    Through you I should also like to express the appreciation of the Argentine delegation to Mrs  Angie BrooksRandolph of Liberia  for the work she performed as President of the twentyfourth session    From this rostrum  the Argentine Government wishes to express to the delegation of the United Arab Republic its regret and sympathy upon the recent death of His Excellency President Gamal Abdel Nasser  The loss of this outstanding statesman has not only plunged the Arab world into mourning  but has also deeply grieved all those who greatly valued his capacity to contribute actively to the establishment of peace in the Middle East    When the Organization of the United Nations was created in   its founders had two fundamental purposes in mind  on the one hand  solemnly to formulate the basic principles of the international system and  on the other  to establish a legal framework in keeping with the political and social needs of the immediate postwar era  Both objectives were the result of the historical experience of mankind and of the interests and aspirations which all civilized nations can in no way renounce  The enunciation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations was thus considered as a sign of moral evolution and maturity of peoples    The need to rely upon a stable management of international relations is also deeply rooted in the history of nations  In the course of time  a number of philosophical and legalpolitical currents proposed guiding principles that went beyond State limits  Up to the beginning of the twentieth century  for more or less lengthy periods  international peace had been ensured by means of treaties signed among the great Powers  These laid the groundwork for peace and de facto established conditions for international stability  The socalled  European concert  is good proof of this concept which restricted the active access of the nonEuropean states to international life    The growing democratization of the international society and the part played in the solution of controversies by the small countries contributed to the crumbling of that restricted concept of the system and to laying the foundations for a legalpolitical structure of worldwide scope resting upon the consent and equality of States based on a distribution of responsibilities  This was precisely what the League of Nations sought to accomplish  The catastrophe of the Second World War is the clearest proof of the way in which that organization had to yield to the trends that finally proved it incapable of maintaining peace among States    However  the need for an international normative system was summed up in a number of international instruments and conferences  from the Atlantic Charter in  to Dumbarton Oaks in   It was the San Francisco Conference  however  which was ultimately to adopt the Charter of the United Nations  thus taking those historic aspirations up again and embarking upon a new era in the management of international affairs    It might justifiably have been felt at that time that  when the United Nations linked the ideals of peace and security with the existence of adequate legal machinery that it had thereby ensured international stability and harmony among nations    Today it is not difficult to prove that  although the principles may still be valid  the actual force of many of them is relative  Future historians of this quartercentury will no doubt use as a guiding thread the listings of constant violations of those principles in almost all areas of the world  They will also be able to show the lack of efficiency of many measures  the existence of which seemed to end at the time of their adoption    There is a notorious maladjustment between institution and reality  We are not referring here to the discrepancy that may exist between what should be and what factually is  We know that ideals always precede their practical fulfillment  History has shown to what extent ideas that at one time were deemed Utopian gradually became specific and indispensable factors of our everyday life    The discrepancy between the normative framework and reality to which we refer here is of a different nature  We have drawn away from the empiric possibilities that existed  and we sometimes tend to forget that our Organization is supported by the political will of the Member States  Proclaiming principles does not in itself make them realities  and it is not sufficient to multiply the legal machinery when the latter is not based upon the social reality it is intended to regulate    Furthermore  if we are fully aware of the difficulties that our Organization faces in settling important questions bearing on international peace and security  it is difficult to understand how year after year we are willing to allow the agenda of the United Nations to be swollen by secondary items which consume so much time and money and are doomed to remain without solution  The bureaucratic and budgetary growth of our Organization and the useless waste of effort are unavoidable consequences of such an attitude    Mention has been made of the need to revise the Charter  Theoretically speaking we cannot but support such a measure  but from the practical point of view we are fully aware of the almost insuperable problems that such a step implies  Perhaps it might be more worthwhile to make an effort to try to use to the utmost those resources provided for and authorized by the Charter  instead of undertaking a scarcely possible revision  particularly with regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes  If  furthermore  we wish to act with a practical awareness  we must bear in mind that some of the measures approved by this General Assembly or by the Security Council require adequate financial resources for full implementation  Very often extremely serious functional maladjustments are due to the fact that this elementary circumstance has been overlooked    The United Nations will be what its Member States wish it to be  What is most serious is that as we pare down our active participation or neglect the consideration of our possibilities it becomes more difficult to put into practice the Purposes and Principles of the Charter  thus endangering international peace and security    The skepticism and discouragement with which many of our contemporaries gauge the actions of the United Nations are understandable  We  as representatives of the States Members of the Organization  have the duty to be honest with ourselves and to adopt a critical stand that will permit us to judge both our successes and our failures objectively    In order to carry out such an analysis  we might establish a threefold division of problems  First of all  there are those that have been practically or entirely settled  and in this case our satisfaction at what has been accomplished is justified  Secondly  there are those problems that have acquired a chronic degree of gravity and have been awaiting solution for years  In this case discouragement is well founded  and it is urgent that we adopt effective measures to correct the structural and operational flaws in our Organization  Thirdly  there are the new problems created by the emergence of facts that have changed the world situation  In this last case we should act with sufficient determination so that these matters will become part of the first of this series and not swell the ranks of the second group    Decolonization belongs in the first group of problems  This has surely been one of the outstanding phenomena of our day  New States in full enjoyment of their sovereignty  have become active participants in the international system  The principle of the self determination of peoples has thus found its true application  and its observance has helped to enrich the international political situation  Resolution   XV   the tenth anniversary of which we shall soon be marking  served to hasten the windingup process of the colonialist regimes and to ensure a greater equality  at least in the political field  among the peoples of the world  The Argentine Republic is firmly convinced that decolonization must be totally carried out    For that reason we continue to be concerned over the situation of the Territories of southern Africa which still remain under colonial administration  Within this context  the atmosphere is further troubled by the existence of a Government which illegally holds power in Southern Rhodesia  by the racial discrimination that is represented by apartheid and by the non recognition of the authority of the United Nations of which we are witnesses in Namibia    In this context I wish to refer to a matter of vital importance to the Argentine Republic  the question of the Malvinas Islands  True to its diplomatic traditions  my Government agreed to negotiate with the United Kingdom regarding the dispute over the sovereignty of the islands  In so doing  we were interpreting the spirit and the letter of resolution   XX  and  at the same time  we declared our irrevocable decision shared by all the people of Argentina to have the Malvinas Islands restored to our territorial  heritage  Since the end of the last session of this General Assembly negotiations have continued on the diplomatic level  It was with great interest that we pursued the talks regarding the problem of communications between the Islands and the Argentine mainland  for we believe that these are the first steps towards the solution of the dispute  In due course  we shall report on the results of these talks    Those whose votes have made it possible for Argentina and the United Kingdom to begin their talks with a view to ending a situation which is incompatible with the terms of resolution   XV  did so because they considered that decolonization is an irreversible process that brooks no exceptions  There can  furthermore  be no doubt that the question of the Malvinas Islands is an obstacle to the development of the ties that should link Argentina with the United Kingdom increasingly closely  Therefore  the solution to this problem cannot be unduly delayed  My Government reaffirms is right to raise the matter again in this Assembly if the talks fail or if they are excessively prolonged    We believe it urgent that these cases should be solved so that they will not remain to swell the number of problems in the second of the groups I have mentioned  that is  the problems pending solution    The question of general and complete disarmament also belongs in this category  If we consider the consequences of the qualitative development of the new systems of weaponry on the life of international society  it is difficult to presume that the efforts to achieve an easing of political tension within the system can possibly show lasting results while the arsenals of the great Powers remain at their present levels or are increased    For this reason my Government attaches considerable importance to the strategic arms limitation talks which are taking place bilaterally between the United States and the Soviet Union  but we feel it necessary to recall the fact that urgent measures should be adopted for nuclear disarmament within the context of general and complete disarmament under effective international control    Argentina continues to participate actively in the deliberations of the Conference of the Committee  on disarmament convinced as it is of the vital importance of seeking ari understanding that might help to dissipate the threat of a nuclear catastrophe    That Conference has submitted to this present session a draft treaty prohibiting the emplacement of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and ocean floors and on the subsoil thereof   The document on which we are now to take a stand contains significant changes compared to the one that was considered at the twentyfourth session of the General Assembly  Some of these tend to protect the legitimate interests of the coastal States and at the same time prevent those provisions covering verification from prejudging matters touching upon the law of the sea  Argentina attaches special relevance to all of these principles  as is attested to by our active participation in the amendment of the previous draft  The text  such as it has been presented to the General Assembly  has our support and we hope that it will be approved by a widespread majority of Member States    The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has continued the examination of the question of chemical and bacteriological  biological  weapons on the basis of the two draft conventions and other proposals which were submitted to it  The Committee has dedicated itself to the treatment of both types of armaments and has seriously considered the political and technical aspects pertaining to the subject  My Government attaches special significance to the problem of verification procedures which it might be necessary to adopt  It is to be hoped that the General Assembly will recommend that the Committee should continue this task which  although difficult  is nevertheless most necessary    With regard to the elaboration of a detailed program on general and complete disarmament  the report submitted by the Committee shows that this matter was one of its main concerns  We deem it advisable to reiterate that the aim of the program must be the achieving of general and complete disarmament under effective international control  On various occasions we had already warned about the negative consequences of collateral measures which  because of their discriminatory character  actually constitute the  disarmament of the unarmed  and do not signify a true contribution to the achievement of a true general armaments reduction    There can be no doubt that the conflict in the Middle East is one of the typical cases that has not as yet found a settlement within the framework of the United Nations  It is to be hoped that the encouraging symptoms noticed lately will help to allay the suspicions that have been felt by both parties  Thus the first steps may then be taken towards the effective implementation of resolution     of the Security Council  in the drafting of which Argentina played a significant part  We believe that this resolution points to the right road to peace  Furthermore  my Government reaffirms its faith in the Jarring mission as a means towards understanding and  through the participation of Argentine officers  will continue to cooperate in the supervision of the ceasefire in the Suez Canal area    SouthEast Asia is also a source of serious concern  That grave problem can be settled only if negotiations among those directly involved are pursued in a spirit in keeping with the Charter  The continuous delays which hinder the elimination of this permanent breach of the peace are contrary to the purposes of the United Nations    We cannot in this context overlook the constant danger being run by those who  in their capacity as news correspondents  are present in the zone of conflict in order to carry out their difficult task of keeping world public opinion informed of the battles more efficiently and accurately  Respect for human rights during armed conflicts requires special observance in the case of news correspondents during hostilities  My own country is prepared to consider measures to guarantee greater security to those engaged in this important work    Both the situation in the Middle East and that of SouthEast Asia are of concern to the community of nations not only because of the constant losses in human lives  but also because  despite their apparently regional nature  they may endanger the security of the entire system  We know full well that the interests at stake in this case go beyond th  direct participants in the struggle  Reference to these cases is necessary in a statement made before this Assembly  The trouble with periodic repetitions is that the problems we are analyzing tend to become Commonplace  Nothing could be more grave and serious than to accustom ourselves to living with war and destruction and to think that both are inevitable at a given time in history  Our insistence therefore in referring to these conflicts must not be interpreted as a repetition of just another rhetorical sentence  but as the proof of a deeply felt concern    Among the third group of problems mentioned  that is  those that have emerged recently  must be listed a question that warrants special attention because it seriously bears upon international peace and security  I refer to the committing of acts of violence and terrorism that constitute true crimes in terms of international criminal law  Violence and subversion  especially in Latin America  have acquired such a scope and magnitude in certain cases as to affect the very basis of international order  If we truly wish to practice tolerance as a fundamental attribute of democracy in our continent  we cannot permit indiscriminate violence  alleging pretexts of confused political ideals in order to convert crimes offensive to human conscience into instruments of social transformation  The Argentine people categorically rejects the committing of those crimes  which are completely alien to its way of life and to the philosophy of freedom which supports it    In the Organization of American States the Republic of Argentina has pointed out the need to define and then to prevent and to punish this type of crime  The Argentine Government understands that it js incumbent upon each State to adopt those measures it deems necessary to repress acts that violate order and security within its own territory  Yet the knowledge that in many cases terrorists and kidnappers receive some kind of foreign assistance in the form of money  weapons or training forces us to consider the need to encourage concerted action on a worldwide scale so that those individuals will not escape justice  Within the regional framework  the InterAmerican Juridical Committee four days ago  on  September  approved a draft convention on terrorism and kidnapping of persons with a view to extortion  which will be submitted for the consideration of members of the Organization of American States  It should be pointed out that article  of that draft provides that the Convention will remain open  for signature by the member States of the Organization of American States  as well as any other State Member of the United Nations or any other State invited to do so by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States     The increasing frequency of acts of hijacking deserves unanimous condemnation by all States Members of the Organization  Argentina considers that the United Nations should adopt adequate measures to prevent recurrence of this crime    I wish now to refer to one of the subjects of greatest significance on the agenda of this twentyfifth session of the General Assembly  namely  the Second United Nations Development Decade and the plan for a global strategy which we are to set in motion during the commemorative period of the present session  Lengthy has been the road covered in the last few years in order to put into practice the principles of the Charter in matters of international cooperation for economic and social progress of all peoples  A clear example of this is what took place during the decade of the s when  for the first time  an effort was made to establish equal opportunities for countries at different levels of development  through a systematization of efforts to achieve specific growth objectives  During those years the aspirations of the developing countries were clearly seen and intense multilateral activity took place    In the various United Nations specialized agencies  in the Economic and Social Council and in the General Assembly  we have in the last few years succeeded in identifying the elements on which to base national efforts and international cooperation  Those elements have been embodied in a considerable number of documents on global and sectoral objectives for economic and social development  With regard to these objectives  there exists an almost unanimous agreement on the part of the different sectors  or at least a sound and honest will to reach a compromise    The study of the final form the agreements on political measures for tne fulfillment of those objectives should have is at present in the last stage of negotiation  and it is a promising sign that those talks are not on the substance of the problem but only on a timetable for implementation  This fact alone renders obvious the spirit in which the international community is entering the decade of the seventies  a decade which will be called upon to put into practice agreed measures for the achievement of the objectives of development    In the implementation of those measures an equal share of responsibility will be borne by both the developed and the developing countries  It is a matter of uniting efforts and of adding to the solidarity of the more industrialized nations  as well as the determination of the other countries to make serious and continuous progress along the road of their own development  Sterile confrontations or the complacency of the recipients of aid can only delay solutions and benefit those who thrive on inertia  For this reason we believe in conciliating interests  Our strategy must consist in promoting a range of positive solutions which  by gradually including new measures or widening the scope of already adopted instruments  will raise to an increasingly high and efficient level economic cooperation among all Members of the Organization  Only thus will we reach the targets set for the Second United Nations Development Decade    One of the factors that has had the greatest impact on the history of the last twentyfive years has been the astounding progress of science and technology  Ours has been called the era of the scientific civilization  That description is not an arbitrary one  Never before has the destiny of mankind depended so much on the rational conquest of nature  Never before have discoveries in the field of science and their immediate application through technology so substantially altered human and interState relations  Those countries which lack adequate means in order to utilize science and technology fully will be left outside the flow of history  The intellectual power has today become the fourth sector of the economy  The advanced communities are in fact  study societies     The Argentine Republic is ready to intensify further the policy of achieving agreements with other States for cooperation and mutual assistance in the field of science and technology  Within the United Nations we shall support as we do in the Organization of American States any proposals designed to encourage basic research and the transfer of applied technology  We believe that if this transfer is not carried out and if international sharing of the burdens of research is not increased  all other efforts made to bridge the gaps between countries at different levels of development will be in vain    We firmly believe that multilateral cooperation  such as that carried out in the specialized agencies and bodies  particularly in the United Nations Development program  is a proof of what the United Nations can achieve when there is apolitical will of commitment in the field of assistance    When modern science and technology became a decisive factor in international life  new fields were opened up for the legal regulation or settlement of relations among States  One of these was that of the seabed and ocean floor  Argentina considers that the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction should be considered the common heritage of mankind  It is unfortunate that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the SeaBed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction has not yet reached an agreement on a declaration of principles to be submitted to the General Assembly  in accordance with the terms of resolution  B  XXIV   The Republic of Argentina believes that the Declaration of principles should reflect the necessary adaptation of the law to the changes that occur in international life    Once the Committee has drafted the regime applicable to the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  the time will have come for the convening of a comprehensive conference on the law of the sea  That conference will have  to deal with all those aspects that may require revision or establishment due to the appearance of interests or situations calling for new international legal regulation  Thus  the criteria set forth by the General Assembly in resolution  B  XXIV  will be complied with    Argentina wishes to express its satisfaction at the work done by the Special Committee on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States  My country has had the honor of participating in the work of the Special Committee since its creation in  and has endeavored at all times to make a most constructive contribution to its deliberations  We consider that the draft declaration that has finally been prepared is a valuable document for the codification and progressive development of fundamental principles of international law and we are ready to give it our full support when it is considered by the General Assembly    When the Charter of the United Nations was signed in the city of San Francisco twentyfive years ago  precisely  years had elapsed since publication of a short essay of prophetic intuition  In his native city of Konigsberg  Emmanuel Kant  in   published his  Essay on perpetual peace   In it he attempted to show that universal peace was not only desirable and conceivable  but necessary and inevitable  In order to achieve it  there had to exist an international order based on a law consented to by all nations  Thus    each State  even the smallest  could expect respect for its security and its rights  not through its own power or its own definition of the law  but simply as the result of the existence of a great society of nations  all abiding by laws adopted through their united will     The important fact in our day is that this united will for peace  considered as an indivisible entity  should be universal in scope  Perhaps the very stability of our international system as a conditioning factor requires that we do not set aside the undeniable factual realities of the world of today  If this be the case  then we have the right to wonder how this concern can be rendered compatible with a restricted universalization of the United Nations    In the course of this statement we have mentioned a series of facts that are of concern to us as they affect peace or hamper the effective achievement of international cooperation  I do not believe it difficult to agree with this analysis  But this would not be complete without mentioning  as one of the undeniable achievements of the Organization  the fact that it has localized and solved some of the conflicts that might have had serious effects on international peace and security  The United Nations has effectively contributed to keeping alive our awareness of the danger to all mankind of a generalized conflict  It is this very awareness which leads us to view with interest the signing of the recent Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the USSR which will contribute to detente in Europe    A hundred years ago  a great Argentine thinker  Juan Bautista Alberdi  wrote that   War is the justice every one works out for himself failing world justice  World justice is lacking because the world is deprived of unity and does not as yet constitute an international society  Therefore  the way to abolish war is to help the consolidation of the world into a State of States  a society of societies  a nation of nations  as a type of entity to work out a justice that  today  everyone works out for himself  by means of war     In   we now have this  nation of nations   If justice is to be imposed by the threat or use of force  and if man  in all areas  has not yet achieved the dignity he deserves  the future will hold us responsible    The  Argentine Republic  within the framework of its international commitments  will maintain the principle of freedom of action of its foreign policy in an ever increasingly interdependent world and pledges all its efforts to fulfill the desire for peace and cooperation which twentyfive years ago was embodied in the Charter of the United Nations</td>\n",
       "      <td>it be a fortunate coincidence that precisely at a time when the United Nations be celebrate its first twentyfive year of existence   an eminent jurist so closely link to our Organization should have be elect to preside over the General Assembly   on behalf of the Argentine Government   it be a pleasure for I to congratulate your Excellency   Mr   President   on this felicitous choice     through you I should also like to express the appreciation of the argentine delegation to Mrs   Angie BrooksRandolph of Liberia   for the work she perform as President of the twentyfourth session     from this rostrum   the Argentine Government wish to express to the delegation of the United Arab Republic its regret and sympathy upon the recent death of his Excellency President Gamal Abdel Nasser   the loss of this outstanding statesman have not only plunge the arab world into mourn   but have also deeply grieve all those who greatly value his capacity to contribute actively to the establishment of peace in the Middle East     when the Organization of the United Nations be create in    its founder have two fundamental purpose in mind   on the one hand   solemnly to formulate the basic principle of the international system and   on the other   to establish a legal framework in keep with the political and social need of the immediate postwar era   both objective be the result of the historical experience of mankind and of the interest and aspiration which all civilized nation can in no way renounce   the enunciation of the purpose and principle of the United Nations be thus consider as a sign of moral evolution and maturity of people     the need to rely upon a stable management of international relation be also deeply root in the history of nation   in the course of time   a number of philosophical and legalpolitical current propose guide principle that go beyond State limit   up to the beginning of the twentieth century   for more or less lengthy period   international peace have be ensure by mean of treaty sign among the great Powers   these lay the groundwork for peace and de facto establish condition for international stability   the socalled   european concert   be good proof of this concept which restrict the active access of the noneuropean state to international life     the grow democratization of the international society and the part play in the solution of controversy by the small country contribute to the crumbling of that restrict concept of the system and to lay the foundation for a legalpolitical structure of worldwide scope rest upon the consent and equality of States base on a distribution of responsibility   this be precisely what the League of Nations seek to accomplish   the catastrophe of the Second World War be the clear proof of the way in which that organization have to yield to the trend that finally prove it incapable of maintain peace among States     however   the need for an international normative system be sum up in a number of international instrument and conference   from the Atlantic Charter in   to Dumbarton Oaks in    it be the San Francisco Conference   however   which be ultimately to adopt the Charter of the United Nations   thus take those historic aspiration up again and embark upon a new era in the management of international affair     it might justifiably have be feel at that time that   when the United Nations link the ideal of peace and security with the existence of adequate legal machinery that it have thereby ensure international stability and harmony among nation     today it be not difficult to prove that   although the principle may still be valid   the actual force of many of they be relative   future historian of this quartercentury will no doubt use as a guide thread the listing of constant violation of those principle in almost all area of the world   they will also be able to show the lack of efficiency of many measure   the existence of which seem to end at the time of their adoption     there be a notorious maladjustment between institution and reality   we be not refer here to the discrepancy that may exist between what should be and what factually be   we know that ideal always precede their practical fulfillment   history have show to what extent idea that at one time be deem Utopian gradually become specific and indispensable factor of our everyday life     the discrepancy between the normative framework and reality to which we refer here be of a different nature   we have draw away from the empiric possibility that exist   and we sometimes tend to forget that our Organization be support by the political will of the Member States   Proclaiming principle do not in itself make they reality   and it be not sufficient to multiply the legal machinery when the latter be not base upon the social reality it be intend to regulate     furthermore   if we be fully aware of the difficulty that our Organization face in settle important question bear on international peace and security   it be difficult to understand how year after year we be willing to allow the agenda of the United Nations to be swell by secondary item which consume so much time and money and be doom to remain without solution   the bureaucratic and budgetary growth of our Organization and the useless waste of effort be unavoidable consequence of such an attitude     Mention have be make of the need to revise the Charter   theoretically speak we can not but support such a measure   but from the practical point of view we be fully aware of the almost insuperable problem that such a step imply   perhaps it might be more worthwhile to make an effort to try to use to the utmost those resource provide for and authorize by the Charter   instead of undertake a scarcely possible revision   particularly with regard to the peaceful settlement of dispute   if   furthermore   we wish to act with a practical awareness   we must bear in mind that some of the measure approve by this General Assembly or by the Security Council require adequate financial resource for full implementation   very often extremely serious functional maladjustment be due to the fact that this elementary circumstance have be overlook     the United Nations will be what its Member States wish it to be   what be most serious be that as we pare down our active participation or neglect the consideration of our possibility it become more difficult to put into practice the Purposes and Principles of the Charter   thus endanger international peace and security     the skepticism and discouragement with which many of our contemporary gauge the action of the United Nations be understandable   we   as representative of the States Members of the Organization   have the duty to be honest with ourselves and to adopt a critical stand that will permit we to judge both our success and our failure objectively     in order to carry out such an analysis   we might establish a threefold division of problem   first of all   there be those that have be practically or entirely settle   and in this case our satisfaction at what have be accomplish be justify   secondly   there be those problem that have acquire a chronic degree of gravity and have be await solution for year   in this case discouragement be well found   and it be urgent that we adopt effective measure to correct the structural and operational flaw in our Organization   Thirdly   there be the new problem create by the emergence of fact that have change the world situation   in this last case we should act with sufficient determination so that these matter will become part of the first of this series and not swell the rank of the second group     Decolonization belong in the first group of problem   this have surely be one of the outstanding phenomenon of our day   New States in full enjoyment of their sovereignty   have become active participant in the international system   the principle of the self determination of people have thus find its true application   and its observance have help to enrich the international political situation   Resolution    XV    the tenth anniversary of which we shall soon be mark   serve to hasten the windingup process of the colonialist regime and to ensure a great equality   at least in the political field   among the people of the world   the Argentine Republic be firmly convince that decolonization must be totally carry out     for that reason we continue to be concern over the situation of the Territories of southern Africa which still remain under colonial administration   within this context   the atmosphere be far trouble by the existence of a government which illegally hold power in Southern Rhodesia   by the racial discrimination that be represent by apartheid and by the non recognition of the authority of the United Nations of which we be witness in Namibia     in this context I wish to refer to a matter of vital importance to the Argentine Republic   the question of the Malvinas Islands   true to its diplomatic tradition   my Government agree to negotiate with the United Kingdom regard the dispute over the sovereignty of the island   in so do   we be interpret the spirit and the letter of resolution    XX   and   at the same time   we declare our irrevocable decision share you all the people of Argentina to have the Malvinas Islands restore to our territorial   heritage   since the end of the last session of this General Assembly negotiation have continue on the diplomatic level   it be with great interest that we pursue the talk regard the problem of communication between the Islands and the argentine mainland   for we believe that these be the first step towards the solution of the dispute   in due course   we shall report on the result of these talk     those whose vote have make it possible for Argentina and the United Kingdom to begin their talk with a view to end a situation which be incompatible with the term of resolution    XV   do so because they consider that decolonization be an irreversible process that brook no exception   there can   furthermore   be no doubt that the question of the Malvinas Islands be an obstacle to the development of the tie that should link Argentina with the United Kingdom increasingly closely   therefore   the solution to this problem can not be unduly delay   my Government reaffirm be right to raise the matter again in this Assembly if the talk fail or if they be excessively prolong     we believe it urgent that these case should be solve so that they will not remain to swell the number of problem in the second of the group I have mention   that be   the problem pende solution     the question of general and complete disarmament also belong in this category   if we consider the consequence of the qualitative development of the new system of weaponry on the life of international society   it be difficult to presume that the effort to achieve an easing of political tension within the system can possibly show last result while the arsenal of the great power remain at their present level or be increase     for this reason my Government attach considerable importance to the strategic arm limitation talk which be take place bilaterally between the United States and the Soviet Union   but we feel it necessary to recall the fact that urgent measure should be adopt for nuclear disarmament within the context of general and complete disarmament under effective international control     Argentina continue to participate actively in the deliberation of the Conference of the Committee   on disarmament convince as it be of the vital importance of seek ari understanding that might help to dissipate the threat of a nuclear catastrophe     that Conference have submit to this present session a draft treaty prohibit the emplacement of nuclear and other weapon of mass destruction on the seabed and ocean floor and on the subsoil thereof    the document on which we be now to take a stand contain significant change compare to the one that be consider at the twentyfourth session of the General Assembly   some of these tend to protect the legitimate interest of the coastal States and at the same time prevent those provision cover verification from prejudge matter touch upon the law of the sea   Argentina attach special relevance to all of these principle   as be attest to by our active participation in the amendment of the previous draft   the text   such as it have be present to the General Assembly   have our support and we hope that it will be approve by a widespread majority of Member States     the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament have continue the examination of the question of chemical and bacteriological   biological   weapon on the basis of the two draft convention and other proposal which be submit to it   the Committee have dedicate itself to the treatment of both type of armament and have seriously consider the political and technical aspect pertain to the subject   my Government attach special significance to the problem of verification procedure which it might be necessary to adopt   it be to be hope that the General Assembly will recommend that the Committee should continue this task which   although difficult   be nevertheless most necessary     with regard to the elaboration of a detailed program on general and complete disarmament   the report submit by the Committee show that this matter be one of its main concern   we deem it advisable to reiterate that the aim of the program must be the achieving of general and complete disarmament under effective international control   on various occasion we have already warn about the negative consequence of collateral measure which   because of their discriminatory character   actually constitute the   disarmament of the unarmed   and do not signify a true contribution to the achievement of a true general armament reduction     there can be no doubt that the conflict in the Middle East be one of the typical case that have not as yet find a settlement within the framework of the United Nations   it be to be hope that the encouraging symptom notice lately will help to allay the suspicion that have be feel by both party   thus the first step may then be take towards the effective implementation of resolution      of the Security Council   in the drafting of which Argentina play a significant part   we believe that this resolution point to the right road to peace   furthermore   my Government reaffirm its faith in the jarring mission as a means towards understanding and   through the participation of argentine officer   will continue to cooperate in the supervision of the ceasefire in the Suez Canal area     SouthEast Asia be also a source of serious concern   that grave problem can be settle only if negotiation among those directly involve be pursue in a spirit in keeping with the Charter   the continuous delay which hinder the elimination of this permanent breach of the peace be contrary to the purpose of the United Nations     we can not in this context overlook the constant danger be run by those who   in their capacity as news correspondent   be present in the zone of conflict in order to carry out their difficult task of keep world public opinion inform of the battle more efficiently and accurately   respect for human right during armed conflict require special observance in the case of news correspondent during hostility   my own country be prepared to consider measure to guarantee great security to those engage in this important work     both the situation in the Middle East and that of SouthEast Asia be of concern to the community of nation not only because of the constant loss in human life   but also because   despite their apparently regional nature   they may endanger the security of the entire system   we know full well that the interest at stake in this case go beyond th   direct participant in the struggle   reference to these case be necessary in a statement make before this Assembly   the trouble with periodic repetition be that the problem we be analyze tend to become Commonplace   nothing could be more grave and serious than to accustom ourselves to live with war and destruction and to think that both be inevitable at a give time in history   our insistence therefore in refer to these conflict must not be interpret as a repetition of just another rhetorical sentence   but as the proof of a deeply feel concern     among the third group of problem mention   that be   those that have emerge recently   must be list a question that warrant special attention because it seriously bear upon international peace and security   I refer to the committing of act of violence and terrorism that constitute true crime in term of international criminal law   violence and subversion   especially in Latin America   have acquire such a scope and magnitude in certain case as to affect the very basis of international order   if we truly wish to practice tolerance as a fundamental attribute of democracy in our continent   we can not permit indiscriminate violence   allege pretext of confused political ideal in order to convert crime offensive to human conscience into instrument of social transformation   the argentine people categorically reject the committing of those crime   which be completely alien to its way of life and to the philosophy of freedom which support it     in the Organization of American States the Republic of Argentina have point out the need to define and then to prevent and to punish this type of crime   the Argentine Government understand that it js incumbent upon each State to adopt those measure it deem necessary to repress act that violate order and security within its own territory   yet the knowledge that in many case terrorist and kidnapper receive some kind of foreign assistance in the form of money   weapon or training force we to consider the need to encourage concert action on a worldwide scale so that those individual will not escape justice   within the regional framework   the InterAmerican Juridical Committee four day ago   on   September   approve a draft convention on terrorism and kidnapping of person with a view to extortion   which will be submit for the consideration of member of the Organization of American States   it should be point out that article   of that draft provide that the Convention will remain open   for signature by the member States of the Organization of American States   as well as any other State Member of the United Nations or any other state invite to do so by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States      the increase frequency of act of hijacking deserve unanimous condemnation you all States Members of the Organization   Argentina consider that the United Nations should adopt adequate measure to prevent recurrence of this crime     I wish now to refer to one of the subject of great significance on the agenda of this twentyfifth session of the General Assembly   namely   the Second United Nations Development Decade and the plan for a global strategy which we be to set in motion during the commemorative period of the present session   Lengthy have be the road cover in the last few year in order to put into practice the principle of the Charter in matter of international cooperation for economic and social progress of all people   a clear example of this be what take place during the decade of the s when   for the first time   an effort be make to establish equal opportunity for country at different level of development   through a systematization of effort to achieve specific growth objective   during those year the aspiration of the develop country be clearly see and intense multilateral activity take place     in the various United Nations specialized agency   in the Economic and Social Council and in the General Assembly   we have in the last few year succeed in identify the element on which to base national effort and international cooperation   those element have be embody in a considerable number of document on global and sectoral objective for economic and social development   with regard to these objective   there exist an almost unanimous agreement on the part of the different sector   or at least a sound and honest will to reach a compromise     the study of the final form the agreement on political measure for tne fulfillment of those objective should have be at present in the last stage of negotiation   and it be a promising sign that those talk be not on the substance of the problem but only on a timetable for implementation   this fact alone render obvious the spirit in which the international community be enter the decade of the seventy   a decade which will be call upon to put into practice agree measure for the achievement of the objective of development     in the implementation of those measure an equal share of responsibility will be bear by both the develop and the develop country   it be a matter of unite effort and of add to the solidarity of the more industrialized nation   as well as the determination of the other country to make serious and continuous progress along the road of their own development   Sterile confrontation or the complacency of the recipient of aid can only delay solution and benefit those who thrive on inertia   for this reason we believe in conciliate interest   our strategy must consist in promote a range of positive solution which   by gradually include new measure or widen the scope of already adopt instrument   will raise to an increasingly high and efficient level economic cooperation among all member of the Organization   only thus will we reach the target set for the Second United Nations Development Decade     one of the factor that have have the great impact on the history of the last twentyfive year have be the astounding progress of science and technology   Ours have be call the era of the scientific civilization   that description be not an arbitrary one   never before have the destiny of mankind depend so much on the rational conquest of nature   never before have discovery in the field of science and their immediate application through technology so substantially alter human and interstate relation   those country which lack adequate mean in order to utilize science and technology fully will be leave outside the flow of history   the intellectual power have today become the fourth sector of the economy   the advanced community be in fact   study society      the Argentine Republic be ready to intensify far the policy of achieve agreement with other state for cooperation and mutual assistance in the field of science and technology   within the United Nations we shall support as we do in the Organization of American States any proposal design to encourage basic research and the transfer of apply technology   we believe that if this transfer be not carry out and if international sharing of the burden of research be not increase   all other effort make to bridge the gap between country at different level of development will be in vain     we firmly believe that multilateral cooperation   such as that carry out in the specialized agency and body   particularly in the United Nations Development program   be a proof of what the United Nations can achieve when there be apolitical will of commitment in the field of assistance     when modern science and technology become a decisive factor in international life   new field be open up for the legal regulation or settlement of relation among States   one of these be that of the seabed and ocean floor   Argentina consider that the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limit of national jurisdiction should be consider the common heritage of mankind   it be unfortunate that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the SeaBed and the Ocean Floor beyond the limit of National Jurisdiction have not yet reach an agreement on a declaration of principle to be submit to the General Assembly   in accordance with the term of resolution   B   xxiv    the Republic of Argentina believe that the Declaration of principle should reflect the necessary adaptation of the law to the change that occur in international life     once the Committee have draft the regime applicable to the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limit of national jurisdiction   the time will have come for the convening of a comprehensive conference on the law of the sea   that conference will have   to deal with all those aspect that may require revision or establishment due to the appearance of interest or situation call for new international legal regulation   thus   the criterion set forth by the General Assembly in resolution   B   XXIV   will be comply with     Argentina wish to express its satisfaction at the work do by the Special Committee on Principles of International Law concern Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States   my country have have the honor of participate in the work of the Special Committee since its creation in   and have endeavor at all time to make a most constructive contribution to its deliberation   we consider that the draft declaration that have finally be prepare be a valuable document for the codification and progressive development of fundamental principle of international law and we be ready to give it our full support when it be consider by the General Assembly     when the Charter of the United Nations be sign in the city of San

       "      <td>It is a pleasure for me to extend to you  Mr  President  the warmest congratulations of the Australia Government and its delegation to this General Assembly on your election to the Presidency  The distinguished part you have played in the service of your country and in the development of this Organization  notably through your authoritative study of the Charter  makes you a fitting and admirable choice to preside over this session    In congratulating you I also want to express through you the thanks and appreciation of the Australian delegation for the efficient and dedicated manner in which your predecessor  Mrs  Angie Brooks Randolph of Liberia  discharged her responsibilities as President of the twentyfourth session    As so many of my colleagues have said  this twentyfifth anniversary session is an appropriate occasion to examine the workings of our Organization its successes and failures  its merits and shortcomings    looking back to  we should keep in mind the a     nations of the founder Members of the United Nations in San Francisco and the problems they had to solve    Today  under the compulsion of circumstances and events  we must ask ourselves  o what extent the United Nations has succeeded  I  paramount and immediate importance  we must ask whether we can make any contribution to improving its performance  This  I emphasize  is the greatest test of statesmanship and sincerity of our times    Let us recall the conditions that existed when the Charter was signed  It was an unhappy and disturbed world in which the most destructive war of all times was still being fought  a war in which my country and many others  large and small  were still heavily involved  a war wnidi had directly or indirectly dominated people s daily lives everywhere throughout six years of struggle against violent and tyrannical oppression  It was a more disturbed world than that which had given birth a generation earlier to the League of Nations  It was a world in which there was a passionate yearning for peace and order  for a system of rules for the orderly conduct of relations between nations  for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for the improvement of the quality of life for all mankind    In this mood of hope and determination our Governments met in San Francisco  There was never much disagreement about the name to be given to the new Organization  the worldwide alliance of Powers  then within sight of final victory   had already become known as the United Nations    The forging of its Charter  on the other hand  was necessarily a more difficult process  After the traumatic experience of the Second World War the nations united in war were ready enough to recognize the need for a more broadly based and more effective institution than the League of Nations  a new institution which would have to accommodate the aspirations and interests of more than fifty nations  The major Powers had differences to reconcile amongst themselves and the rights of the smaller nations were vigorously pressed  not least of all by the Australian delegation  Thus the Charter that emerged was inevitably the product of compromise  implicit as well as explicit  This should be recognized in any evaluation of the past    The Charter was founded on the proposition that the major allied Powers  those which carried the heaviest burden of the war  would share the main responsibility for preserving the peace  If this concept was to be successful it had to be postulated on the continued existence among the major allies of the same unity of purpose that had carried them to the point of victory and on a common interest in maintaining world peace in  he future  It was with that expectation  indeed on t edition  that the major allies were given a special position under the Charter  with rights and obligations exceeding those of all other Members    Even before the Charter was signed  suspicion and discord had arisen amongst them  Succeeding years have seen an intensified conflict of ideologies and worldwide clashes of national interests  At times it even seemed that the objective was conflict and turmoil and not peace and security  and the promotion  rather than the suppression  of armed conflict in areas of competitive interest  Those differences of outlook  interests and ideology among the permanent members of the Security Council have prevented the Council from performing the role intended for it by the Charter    We cm speculate about what might have happened if the Military Staff Committee  so hopefully envisaged under Chapter VII of the Charter  had been allowed to take shape and to assume the functions planned for it    We might also deplore our failure to settle the question of how the costs of peacekeeping operations are to be shared equitably    Having said that  we should acknowledge that we have been spared the horrors of a third world war  Undoubtedly  the basic explanation up to the present has been the rapid development of weapon technology  Another world war has been too horrible for any nation to contemplate  No one could win  The world as a whole would be certain to suffer disastrous consequences    The United Nations may perhaps claim some small credit for providing a safety valve for public debate and a forum in which the great Powers have been forced to explain and justify their attitudes and actions  In its twentyfive years the United Nations has not been able to prevent a number of limited wars of the conventional type  nor has it found the answer to insidious threats to national integrity and security through the newly developed techniques of infiltration  subversion and insurgency    The peacekeeping record has not  however  been wholly bleak  Korea is an illustration  even without agreement among the major Powers  In the Middle East  Kashmir  the Congo and Cyprus  United Nations forces and truce supervisory teams have in the past played a significant role in critical situations which could have grown considerably worse without their presence    Despite strains  divisions and its limited record of achievement in its primary role  th  United Nations has survived for twentyfive years  That indicates that many Members recognize that there is a residual or net value in the Organization and that they still hope for a future in which it will perform functions which measure up to their expectations    As we look to the future  it is surely no exaggeration to say that the reputation of the United Nations and the degree of respect it enjoys among people everywhere will hinge on its performance in helping to settle disputes among nations and in keeping the peace    Undoubtedly  there is room for improvement in the peacekeeping procedures of the Organization and the machinery provided for the settlement of disputes  But practical success in this peacekeeping role must depend ultimately on subjective factors the attitudes  intentions and honesty of purpose of the great Powers and of the individual nations concerned in particular disputes    Australia has consistently supported the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations with both men and money  As early as  we were one of the three members of one of the first mediation and peacekeeping missions set up by the United Nations the United Nations Commission for Indonesia  We contributed substantial forces to the United Nations action in Korea    At the present time we are making a significant contribution to peace observation and supervision in Kashmir  the Middle East and Cyprus  We will continue  as a member of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations  to support efforts to formulate procedures designed to increase the effectiveness of future operations and to ensure that they are properly financed  We will continue to maintain our firm belief in the United Nations Charter and are convinced that in the faithful and devoted support of its principles lies the best hope for the future peace and progress of mankind    From peacekeeping and the peaceful settlement of disputes  let me turn to the painful and difficult problem of arms control and the reduction of armaments  The constant and frightening improvement in military technology and the complexity of the problems involved in effecting balanced armament reductions make the subject of disarmament a difficult one for most to understand  This difficulty of understanding is  no excuse for thinking it is an academic exercise divorced from the realities of daily living    All of us know that the continuing discussions and negotiations on the control and reduction of armaments  protracted  complex and technical as they are  can vitally affect the security of all countries  Security may be indivisible  but dangers to security vary in nature and degree from region to region and from country to country    The advent of the nuclear balance of terror and the knowledge of other equally horrifying weapons of mass destruction have brought home to us forcibly how vulnerable we are to the whims of scientific progress in the notoriously accidentprone hands of mankind  Surely it is right that our efforts to control armaments should concentrate in the first instance on limiting and controlling weapons of mass destruction    That said  it should be added that a worldwide balance of force  if it is to be effective in containing aggression and preserving security  must include the balance of conventional as well as nuclear armaments  It is with conventional weapons that the many acts of aggression have been committed in the years since the Charter came into force  and we must unhappily expect that there will be more  To pay less attention to the threat that is familiar and traditional than to the threat that is almost unimaginable but controllable is contrary to our mutual interests and welfare    I believe we can be a little encouraged by the progress that has been made in arms control and disarmament  First  Australia has signed the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons subject to certain understandings and interpretations  We hope it will in time become a fully effective barrier against the proliferation of nuclear weapons  Secondly  indications of progress in the strategic arms limitation talks between the United States and the Soviet Union also offer some hope  Thirdly  the prospect of agreement to prevent the placing of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed is also welcome  The Australian Government hopes that the text of the draft treaty now before the Assembly will gain widespread support  Fourthly  there are also grounds for hope that  as a result of discussion at the conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva this year  we may be at or near the threshold of substantive progress towards supplementing and strengthening the prohibitions on chemical and biological weapons of war that already exist in the Geneva Protocol of     I have spoken at length about the influences that affect the balance between peace and war because the paramount purpose of the United Nations must still be to preserve peace and outlaw war and because this paramount purpose has not always been well served    Let me turn now to another purpose of the Charter which can be measured by the increase in membership of the United Nations in twentyfive years  I refer to the progress from dependent status to full sovereignty and statehood of more than half of the present Members of the Organization    The circumstances in which those sections of the Charter relating to dependent Territories came to be drafted in San Francisco are worth remembering  The Covenant of the League of Nations broke new ground  It introduced and put into effect in the Mandate system the novel concept that the international community held a degree of responsibility for the guidance of colonial peoples towards selfgovernment and independence  By  that concept had been strengthened and developed by the experiences of the Second World War  selfdetermination for dependent Territories became the accepted goal  and was given wider and more precise expression in Chapters XI  XII and XIII of the Charter    I note here that the Australian delegation at San Francisco took a particularly active part in the drafting of those Chapters  especially those sections dealing with the rights of the peoples of dependent Territories and the obligations of the administering Powers and of the United Nations towards them    Since that time there have been profound and rapid changes  which are continuing  The Charter set the targets and the standards  It only remained for the metropolitan Powers to accept responsibility for the changes that inevitably had to be made  In most cases they were accepted willingly and generously    There was also a complementary responsibility for the dependent peoples themselves first to understand their opportunities and responsibilities and then work towards achieving them  In some cases freedom and national sovereignty came only after a lengthy and sometimes bitter struggle  in most cases they came more happily as a result of a rational acceptance of the situation by both sides and a peaceful and mutually satisfactory transfer of political power    In this process of the development of dependent peoples to nationhood the United Nations  reflecting the liberal and humanitarian instincts of mankind  and sometimes its impatience  has played a significant part    To be specific  I want to speak briefly about one dependent area of great concern to Australia  in which this process of developing is taking place rapidly  This is the Territory of Papua and New Guinea    Let me describe the position there  It is the largest of the remaining dependent Territories outside the continent of Africa  it lies immediately to the north of Australia  its area is approximately   square miles  and its population totals two and a quarter million  It is a larger unit than many Members of the United Nations  Because of its exceptionally rugged terrain and the successive waves of migration that occurred over the centuries  these two and a quarter million people are divided amongst themselves by ethnic and tribal differences and also by something like  different languages not different dialects  but different languages  It is this fragmented society that is now drawing together into an identifiable nation    My delegation reports each year to this Assembly about the progress made and the difficulties encountered during the preceding twelve months  The proclaimed policy is to ensure the exercise by the people of the Territory of their inalienable right to self determination  We are now doing  and will continue to do  all we can to prepare the people of the Territory for the termination of dependent status and their accession to full selfgovernment and independence    Next year another United Nations Visiting Mission  the seventh  will go to the Territory and will be able to see for itself the striking progress that has been made since the visit of the last Mission in     Earlier this year I had the honor to lead the Australian delegation to the meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East  which recommended that the Territory of Papua and New Guinea be admitted as one of its associate members  a recommendation which has since been unanimously approved by the Economic and Social Council at its fortyninth session     The Australian Government thinks that this approval and other activities  such as participation in the South Pacific Conference  are recognition of the growing national identity of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and further steps along the road towards selfdetermination    I should like now to range northward and westward from New Guinea into Asia  Let me say that I presume to speak about the general situation throughout Asia because of the great importance to this Organization of events there and their particular importance to Australia    In our view  to judge from the agenda of this twentyfifth session  Asia receives less attention than it is entitled to from the General Assembly  I would like to think that this was a good sign  that a peaceful and wellordered Asia offered few serious problems to the international community  Up to a point this may be true  In the view of my Government it is fair to say that apart from the few serious and easily identifiable major problems  there is evidence throughout eastern  southeastern and southern Asia of a measure of stability  vitality and economic progress that we would not have dared to hope for twenty years ago    Of these major problems China is critical  We shall again be considering the question of the representation of China in the United Nations  Australia  situated at the edge of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to SouthEast Asia  is more concerned with its longterm relations with mainland China than most Members of this Organization  We see plenty of evidence to our north of how much the enormous size  power  and influence of mainland China intrude into and affect the interests and the calculations of smaller nations  My predecessors in office  when speaking to the Assembly  have emphasized that the problem of China s relations with its immediate neighbors and with the rest of the world outside Asia is much greater and more complex than the question of Communist China s admission to this Assembly    We see as clearly as anyone the need for an accommodation with the Peking regime  and we are as anxious as anyone that an accommodation be achieved  But we constantly run up against the mirror image  in its conduct of its external relations  of the ruthlessness and harshness which have been a feature of the present regime s treatment of its own people  Above all  we are conscious of the need for a settlement of the future of the people of Taiwan that takes full account of the wishes of  million people  more than the population of Australia and oft the majority of Member countries of the United Nations  The interests and welfare of  million people are not to be treated as an incidental consideration in some package deal  The Assembly has a grave responsibility to ensure that the status and the rights of these people are protected and guaranteed    It is sometimes claimed that the admission of Communist China to the United Nations will act as a catalyst in opening the way to better relations between China and that part of the international community from which Peking seems to have chosen to isolate itself  We do not at present share this optimistic view  On the other hand  we suppose that the adoption by Communist China of a more reasonable attitude towards international society as a whole  and towards the purposes and principles of the Charter  would facilitate its entry into this Organization    I turn next to the gravest problem now facing us in Asia  It is an unhappy reflection of the failure of the United Nations in its primary role of keeper of the peace that the VietNam situation has never been properly debated here  let alone considered as to possible action  Everywhere else  of course  the VietNam war has been for five years and more one of the great divisive issues of our time  It is understandable that the world s conscience should have revolted against the fearful losses and hardships that the people of VietNam have suffered almost without interruption since well before the United Nations came into being  It is less understandable  in the view of the Australian Government  that the people of South VietNam who are manifestly the victims of aggression in its most naked and ruthless form and the elected Government of South VietNam which has demonstrated beyond doubt that it reflects the wishes of the great majority of the people should have had to undergo so much biased and totally unfair criticism    The outrages they have been compelled to endure from their internal and external aggressors  acting in complete defiance of the Geneva Agreements of   need to be precisely stated  Intimidation  kidnapping  extortion and assassinations have the same meaning in anyone s language  whatever devices are employed to present them under the guise of  liberation     The day may come we all hope it will when the people of North and South VietNam can be reunited  In the meantime there is a wellmarked boundary between the north and the south  Both halves of VietNam could begin to achieve the economic stability and wellbeing of some of their neighbors if only the regime in Hanoi could be persuaded to give up its hopeless struggle and withdraw behind the demilitarized zone    The spillover of the VietNam conflict into neighboring Laos and Cambodia is well enough known to this Assembly  at least in general terms  The representatives of those countries will  I am sure  describe it in detail    Australia has been active throughout the past decade in helping the Government of Laos to maintain a stable economy and thereby to resist the familiar pressures and encroachments of an alien and unwanted ideology    More recently the same kinds of pressure have been brought to bear on Cambodia  There the North VietNamese aggression was a blatant violation of the country s neutrality and independence  In May of this year the Australian Government took part in a regional conference of Foreign Ministers held in Djakarta to consider this enlarged threat    That meeting of Foreign Ministers was a constructive initiative by the Asian countries most directly concerned to try to ensure respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and neutrality of Cambodia  The collective view of that meeting was subsequently communicated accurately and forcefully to the Secretary General  to the Governments of the major Powers and in a number of other capitals by three selected envoys from the group    I sincerely hope that the General Assembly will recognize this as a valuable regional initiative that is not only provided for but encouraged under Chapter VIII of the Charter    A great deal has been said  and more is bound to be said in the course of this Assembly  about the situation in the Middle East  Emotions are running high as a result of difficulties that have impeded the United States effort to restart peace talks and because of the recent series of criminal acts against civil aircraft and their passengers  The present situation is extremely delicate  In these circumstances I do not believe that any more detailed comments by me at this stage would be helpful    Let me turn to one other topic  In the last twenty five years the world has seen tremendous progress in the physical sciences and in industrial technology  These advances in science and technology will bring great benefits to mankind  They can also produce major side effects  often of a harmful kind    An international organization like this  concerned with the maintenance of peace and security and the promotion of international economic cooperation and the raising of living standards  must concern itself continuously with these developments  In our view  the United Nations has a significant and urgent responsibility to assist in the application of science and technology to national development in the most constructive and beneficial way  Conversely  we must do all in our power to minimize the harmful effects of technological change    The United Nations has a related responsibility  equally important  to devise an acceptable framework of international law in which the development of science and technology can proceed in those spheres beyond the conventional limits of national jurisdiction  At present the pace of such development is threatening to outstrip the capacity of international lawyers to devise such a framework    It is a matter of regret that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has not been able to negotiate a convention on liability for damage caused by space objects  Australia  with most other countries  has argued strongly in favor of a convention that would provide certain  prompt and equitable compensation for the victims of space damage  This remains an area in which technology is moving dangerously far ahead of the law    Advances in science and technology have also created a need for international legal action in regard to the seas and the seabed  The problems involved are urgent  comprising both the review of old concepts and the development of new ones  The substantive decisions that must be made will be important for Governments and their peoples and for the international community at large    Those who are responsible for taking these decisions must bear in mind that the system or systems they devise will have to deal equitably with differing and often competing national and international interests if they are to gain widespread acceptance  The alternative to coherent multilateral action with respect to the problems of the seas and the seabed could well be an unmanageable situation    Of all the consequences of the introduction and intensive application of new developments to science and technology none has given rise to wider concern than their effects upon the human environment  Our natural surroundings are being increasingly recognized as an irreplaceable part of our heritage  The problems of pollution have arisen in their starkest form in the highly industrialized countries  and it is to be hoped that those countries where pollution of the environment has not yet reached the same crisis point will be able to profit from the lessons learned elsewhere    Australia s own situation  where the noxious byproducts of industrial development are as much a subject for debate and action as the need to develop our natural resources  puts us in a particularly good position to share with all regions of the world the fruits of cur experience in coping with man s environment  As a basis on which a contribution can be made to help solve this problem the Australian Senate recently appointed a Select Committee to report on water pollution  The report has been completed and consideration is now being given to the most appropriate method of preventing further pollution    We do not need to be reminded that this year is not only the twentyfifth anniversary of this Organization but also the first year of the Second United Nations Development Decade  We in Australia understand how fervently the developing countries want the Second Development Decade to succeed  It is in this spirit that our representatives have participated in the various United Nations and other forums which have been discussing the preparations for the Second Development Decade over the past two years  and particularly the aid programs    Three weeks ago I made an extensive review before the Australian Parliament of our policies of assistance for the developing countries  I reaffirmed our position at last week s ministerial meeting in Tokyo of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development    We have long thought that the only valid test of a country s approach to development assistance is its performance and its deeply felt desire to be helpful  We believe that Australia s record of performance compares well with that of others  Our aid to developing countries increased substantially during the s  and I have recently been able to inform the Australian Parliament that it will again increase significantly in the first year of the Second Development Decade    The budget for  provides for US  million of official development assistance that is  assistance under the direction or control of Government  It does not include private capital flows  which are outside our jurisdiction and competence  Mostly  this assistance will be in the form of grants carrying no burden of interest or repayment  This will be an increase of  per cent over the previous financial year  Of this amount   million is appropriated to Asian countries an increase of  per cent over the previous year    I have also recently announced important new plans regarding Australia s intentions to assist  in particular  Indonesia  Cambodia and South VietMam    There is one other aspect of our aid program that I want to mention  We want to ensure flexibility in any statement of aims for the Second Development Decade that may be adopted this year by the Assembly  The reasons are clear  Conditions in the various developing countries are different and require different treatment  Donor countries also face a variety of conditions  and these must influence the commitments they can make    In the view of my Government there has been a tendency  especially here at the United Nations  to concentrate on the gross amount of aid rather than the quantity of official aid and the quality and effectiveness of economic aid  Thus there has been too much preoccupation with percentage targets and dates for reaching them  I have reaffirmed Australia s support for an aid target for donor countries of  per cent of gross national product  as defined by resolution   II  of the second session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which specifically acknowledges the position of capital importing countries like Australia  It is essential  however  not to let debate about the timing and level of targets distract attention from the overall need for donors to increase the amount of their total aid and particularly their official development assistance    I conclude by returning to the present condition of the United Nations and to the faults and merits most of us see in it  Like most large institutions  it threatens to become a prey to bureaucratization  There is a growing danger of rigidity in its proceedings  it threatens to be submerged under an accumulation of paper  committees and subcommittees continue to proliferate and duplication of effort seems to increase    It is a far cry from the day when the late David Owen set up the Secretariat with a desk  a chair and no telephone  Mere survival of the hectic pressures of the three months of a General Assembly session is an achievement in itself  There is a tendency to regard every United Nations resolution as an end in itself and not as a means to an end  In all this there is much room for improvement    It is not basically the Charter that is at fault  though we in Australia would be receptive to change in the Charter if it was thought necessary  We must look elsewhere  Our distinguished SecretaryGeneral  speaking in San Francisco on the twentyfifth anniversary of the signing ceremony  called eloquently on all Member States to  give the Charter a chance   to give it a go and let it succeed    The Foreign Minister of Brazil  in his thoughtful address which opened this debate   reminded us that  with all its shortcomings and frustrations  the United Nations is the only forum in which we can still opt for life  peace and development  As he said  let us use the Organization and let us apply the Charter  We should take this advice to heart    Finally  and above all  we must not lose hope in the United Nations  We must not let ourselves drift into cynicism  We should remember at all times the late Dag Hammarskjold s statement   It is not the Soviet Union nor indeed any ether big Powers who need the United Nations for their protection  it is ail the others  In this sense the Organization is first of all their Organization</td>\n",
       "      <td>it be a pleasure for I to extend to you   Mr   President   the warm congratulation of the Australia Government and its delegation to this General Assembly on your election to the Presidency   the distinguished part you have play in the service of your country and in the development of this Organization   notably through your authoritative study of the Charter   make you a fitting and admirable choice to preside over this session     in congratulate you I also want to express through you the thank and appreciation of the australian delegation for the efficient and dedicated manner in which your predecessor   Mrs   Angie Brooks Randolph of Liberia   discharge her responsibility as President of the twentyfourth session     as so many of my colleague have say   this twentyfifth anniversary session be an appropriate occasion to examine the working of our Organization its success and failure   its merit and shortcoming     look back to   we should keep in mind the a      nation of the founder member of the United Nations in San Francisco and the problem they have to solve     today   under the compulsion of circumstance and event   we must ask ourselves   o what extent the United Nations have succeed   I   paramount and immediate importance   we must ask whether we can make any contribution to improve its performance   this   I emphasize   be the great test of statesmanship and sincerity of our time     let we recall the condition that exist when the Charter be sign   it be an unhappy and disturbed world in which the most destructive war of all time be still be fight   a war in which my country and many other   large and small   be still heavily involve   a war wnidi have directly or indirectly dominate people s daily live everywhere throughout six year of struggle against violent and tyrannical oppression   it be a more disturbed world than that which have give birth a generation early to the League of Nations   it be a world in which there be a passionate yearn for peace and order   for a system of rule for the orderly conduct of relation between nation   for the peaceful settlement of dispute and for the improvement of the quality of life for all mankind     in this mood of hope and determination our government meet in San Francisco   there be never much disagreement about the name to be give to the new Organization   the worldwide alliance of Powers   then within sight of final victory    have already become know as the United Nations     the forging of its Charter   on the other hand   be necessarily a more difficult process   after the traumatic experience of the Second World War the nation unite in war be ready enough to recognize the need for a more broadly base and more effective institution than the League of Nations   a new institution which would have to accommodate the aspiration and interest of more than fifty nation   the major Powers have difference to reconcile amongst themselves and the right of the small nation be vigorously press   not least of all by the australian delegation   thus the Charter that emerge be inevitably the product of compromise   implicit as well as explicit   this should be recognize in any evaluation of the past     the Charter be found on the proposition that the major allied Powers   those which carry the heavy burden of the war   would share the main responsibility for preserve the peace   if this concept be to be successful it have to be postulate on the continued existence among the major ally of the same unity of purpose that have carry they to the point of victory and on a common interest in maintain world peace in   he future   it be with that expectation   indeed on t edition   that the major ally be give a special position under the Charter   with right and obligation exceed those of all other member     even before the Charter be sign   suspicion and discord have arise amongst they   succeed year have see an intensify conflict of ideology and worldwide clash of national interest   at time it even seem that the objective be conflict and turmoil and not peace and security   and the promotion   rather than the suppression   of armed conflict in area of competitive interest   those difference of outlook   interest and ideology among the permanent member of the Security Council have prevent the Council from perform the role intend for it by the Charter     we cm speculate about what might have happen if the Military Staff Committee   so hopefully envisage under Chapter VII of the Charter   have be allow to take shape and to assume the function plan for it     we might also deplore our failure to settle the question of how the cost of peacekeeping operation be to be share equitably     having say that   we should acknowledge that we have be spare the horror of a third world war   Undoubtedly   the basic explanation up to the present have be the rapid development of weapon technology   another world war have be too horrible for any nation to contemplate   no one could win   the world as a whole would be certain to suffer disastrous consequence     the United Nations may perhaps claim some small credit for provide a safety valve for public debate and a forum in which the great Powers have be force to explain and justify their attitude and action   in its twentyfive year the United Nations have not be able to prevent a number of limited war of the conventional type   nor have it find the answer to insidious threat to national integrity and security through the newly develop technique of infiltration   subversion and insurgency     the peacekeeping record have not   however   be wholly bleak   Korea be an illustration   even without agreement among the major Powers   in the Middle East   Kashmir   the Congo and Cyprus   United Nations force and truce supervisory team have in the past play a significant role in critical situation which could have grow considerably bad without their presence     despite strain   division and its limited record of achievement in its primary role   th   United Nations have survive for twentyfive year   that indicate that many member recognize that there be a residual or net value in the Organization and that they still hope for a future in which it will perform function which measure up to their expectation     as we look to the future   it be surely no exaggeration to say that the reputation of the United Nations and the degree of respect it enjoy among people everywhere will hinge on its performance in help to settle dispute among nation and in keep the peace     Undoubtedly   there be room for improvement in the peacekeeping procedure of the Organization and the machinery provide for the settlement of dispute   but practical success in this peacekeeping role must depend ultimately on subjective factor the attitude   intention and honesty of purpose of the great power and of the individual nation concern in particular

Nations Charter and be convince that in the faithful and devoted support of its principle lie the good hope for the future peace and progress of mankind     from peacekeeping and the peaceful settlement of dispute   let I turn to the painful and difficult problem of arm control and the reduction of armament   the constant and frightening improvement in military technology and the complexity of the problem involve in effect balanced armament reduction make the subject of disarmament a difficult one for most to understand   this difficulty of understanding be   no excuse for think it be an academic exercise divorce from the reality of daily live     all of we know that the continue discussion and negotiation on the control and reduction of armament   protract   complex and technical as they be   can vitally affect the security of all country   Security may be indivisible   but danger to security vary in nature and degree from region to region and from country to

because of the great importance to this Organization of event there and their particular importance to Australia     in our view   to judge from the agenda of this twentyfifth session   Asia receive less attention than it be entitle to from the General Assembly   I would like to think that this be a good sign   that a peaceful and wellordere Asia offer few serious problem to the international community   up to a point this may be true   in the view of my government it be fair to say that apart from the few serious and easily identifiable major problem   there be evidence throughout eastern   southeastern and southern Asia of a measure of stability   vitality and economic progress that we would not have dare to hope for twenty year ago     of these major problem China be critical   we shall again be consider the question of the representation of China in the United Nations   Australia   situate at the edge of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to SouthEast Asia   be more concerned with its longterm relation with mainland China than most member of this Organization   we see plenty of evidence to our north of how much the enormous size   power   and influence of mainland China intrude into and affect the interest and the calculation of small nation   my predecessor in office   when speak to the Assembly   have emphasize that the problem of China s relation with its immediate neighbor and with the rest of the world outside Asia be much great and more complex than the question of Communist China s admission to this Assembly     we see as clearly as anyone the need for an accommodation with the Peking regime   and we be as anxious as anyone that an accommodation be achieve   but we constantly run up against the mirror image   in its conduct of its external relation   of the ruthlessness and harshness which have be a feature of the present regime s treatment of its own people   above all   we be conscious of the need for a settlement of the future of the people of Taiwan that take full account of the wish of   million people   more than the population of Australia and oft the majority of Member country of the United Nations   the interest and welfare of   million people be not to be treat as an incidental consideration in some package deal   the Assembly have a grave responsibility to ensure that the status and the right of these people be protect and guarantee     it be sometimes claim that the admission of Communist China to the United Nations will act as a catalyst in open the way to well relation between China and that part of the international community from which Peking seem to have choose to isolate itself   we do not at present share this optimistic view   on the other hand   we suppose that the adoption by Communist China of a more reasonable attitude towards international society as a whole   and towards the purpose and principle of the Charter   would facilitate its entry into this Organization     I turn next to the grave problem now face we in Asia   it be an unhappy reflection of the failure of the United Nations in its primary role of keeper of the peace that the VietNam situation have never be properly debate here   let alone consider as to possible action   everywhere else   of course   the VietNam war have be for five year and more one of the great divisive issue of our time   it be understandable that the world s conscience should have revolt against the fearful loss and hardship that the people of VietNam have suffer almost without interruption since well before the United Nations come into be   it be less understandable   in the view of the australian Government   that the people of South VietNam who be manifestly the victim of aggression in its most naked and ruthless form and the elect Government of South VietNam which have demonstrate beyond doubt that it reflect the wish of the great majority of the people should have have to undergo so much biased and totally unfair criticism     the outrage they have be compel to endure from their internal and external aggressor   act in complete defiance of the Geneva Agreements of    need to be precisely state   intimidation   kidnapping   extortion and assassination have the same meaning in anyone s language   whatever device be employ to present they under the guise of   liberation      the day may come we all hope it will when the people of North and South VietNam can be reunite   in the meantime there be a wellmarked boundary between the north and the south   both half of VietNam could begin to achieve the economic stability and wellbeing of some of their neighbor if only the regime in Hanoi could be persuade to give up its hopeless struggle and withdraw behind the demilitarize zone     the spillover of the VietNam conflict into neighbor Laos and Cambodia be well enough know to this Assembly   at least in general term   the representative of those country will   I be sure   describe it in detail     Australia have be active throughout the past decade in help the Government of Laos to maintain a stable economy and thereby to resist the familiar pressure and encroachment of an alien and unwanted ideology     more recently the same kind of pressure have be bring to bear on Cambodia   there the North VietNamese aggression be a blatant violation of the country s neutrality and independence   in May of this year the Australian Government take part in a regional conference of Foreign Ministers hold in Djakarta to consider this enlarged threat     that meeting of Foreign Ministers be a constructive initiative by the asian country most directly concerned to try to ensure respect for the sovereignty   territorial integrity and neutrality of Cambodia   the collective view of that meeting be subsequently communicate accurately and forcefully to the Secretary General   to the government of the major power and in a number of other capital by three select envoy from the group     I sincerely hope that the General Assembly will recognize this as a valuable regional initiative that be not only provide for but encourage under Chapter VIII of the Charter     a great deal have be say   and more be bind to be say in the course of this Assembly   about the situation in the Middle East   Emotions be run high as a result of difficulty that have impede the United States effort to restart peace talk and because of the recent series of criminal act against civil aircraft and their passenger   the present situation be extremely delicate   in these circumstance I do not believe that any more detailed comment by I at this stage would be helpful     let I turn to one other topic   in the last twenty five year the world have see tremendous progress in the physical science and in industrial technology   these advance in science and technology will bring great benefit to mankind   they can also produce major side effect   often of a harmful kind     an international organization like this   concern with the maintenance of peace and security and the promotion of international economic cooperation and the raising of living standard   must concern itself continuously with these development   in our view   the United Nations have a significant and urgent responsibility to assist in the application of science and technology to national development in the most constructive and beneficial way   conversely   we must do all in our power to minimize the harmful effect of technological change     the United Nations have a relate responsibility   equally important   to devise an acceptable framework of international law in which the development of science and technology can proceed in those sphere beyond the conventional limit of national jurisdiction   at present the pace of such development be threaten to outstrip the capacity of international lawyer to devise such a framework     it be a matter of regret that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space have not be able to negotiate a convention on liability for damage cause by space object   Australia   with most other country   have argue strongly in favor of a convention that would provide certain   prompt and equitable compensation for the victim of space damage   this remain an area in which technology be move dangerously far ahead of the law     Advances in science and technology have also create a need for international legal action in regard to the sea and the seabed   the problem involve be urgent   comprise both the review of old concept and the development of new one   the substantive decision that must be make will be important for government and their people and for the international community at large     those who be responsible for take these decision must bear in mind that the system or system they devise will have to deal equitably with differing and often compete national and international interest if they be to gain widespread acceptance   the alternative to coherent multilateral action with respect to the problem of the sea and the seabed could well be an unmanageable situation     of all the consequence of the introduction and intensive application of new development to science and technology none have give rise to wide concern than their effect upon the human environment   our natural surrounding be be increasingly recognize as an irreplaceable part of our heritage   the problem of pollution have arise in their stark form in the highly industrialize country   and it be to be hope that those country where pollution of the environment have not yet reach the same crisis point will be able to profit from the lesson learn elsewhere     Australia s own situation   where the noxious byproduct of industrial development be as much a subject for debate and action as the need to develop our natural resource   put we in a particularly good position to share with all region of the world the fruit of cur experience in cope with man s environment   as a basis on which a contribution can be make to help solve this problem the australian Senate recently appoint a Select Committee to report on water pollution   the report have be complete and consideration be now be give to the most appropriate method of prevent further pollution     we do not need to be remind that this year be not only the twentyfifth anniversary of this Organization but also the first year of the Second United Nations Development Decade   we in Australia understand how fervently the develop country want the Second Development Decade to succeed   it be in this spirit that our representative have participate in the various United Nations and other forum which have be discuss the preparation for the Second Development Decade over the past two year   and particularly the aid program     three week ago I make an extensive review before the Australian Parliament of our policy of assistance for the develop country   I reaffirm our position at last week s ministerial meeting in Tokyo of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development     we have long think that the only valid test of a country s approach to development assistance be its performance and its deeply feel desire to be helpful   we believe that Australia s record of performance compare well with that of other   our aid to develop country increase substantially during the s   and I have recently be able to inform the australian Parliament that it will again increase significantly in the first year of the Second Development Decade     the budget for   provide for US   million of official development assistance that be   assistance under the direction or control of government   it do not include private capital flow   which be outside our jurisdiction and competence   mostly   this assistance will be in the form of grant carry no burden of interest or repayment   this will be an increase of   per cent over the previous financial year   of this amount    million be appropriate to asian country an increase of   per cent over the previous year     I have also recently announce important new plan regard Australia s intention to assist   in particular   Indonesia   Cambodia and South VietMam     there be one other aspect of our aid program that I want to mention   we want to ensure flexibility in any statement of aim for the Second Development Decade that may be adopt this year by the Assembly   the reason be clear   Conditions in the various develop country be different and require different treatment   Donor country also face a variety of condition   and these must influence the commitment they can make     in the view of my government there have be a tendency   especially here at the United Nations   to concentrate on the gross amount of aid rather than the quantity of official aid and the quality and effectiveness of economic aid   thus there have be too much preoccupation with percentage target and date for reach they   I have reaffirm Australia s support for an aid target for donor country of   per cent of gross national product   as define by resolution    II   of the second session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development   which specifically acknowledge the position of capital import country like Australia   it be essential   however   not to let debate about the timing and level of target distract attention from the overall need for donor to increase the amount of their total aid and particularly their official development assistance     I conclude by return to the present condition of the United Nations and to the fault and merit most of we see in it   like most large institution   it threaten to become a prey to bureaucratization   there be a grow danger of rigidity in its proceeding   it threaten to be submerge under an accumulation of paper   committee and subcommittee continue to proliferate and duplication of effort seem to increase     it be a far cry from the day when the late David Owen set up the Secretariat with a desk   a chair and no telephone   mere survival of the hectic pressure of the three month of a General Assembly session be an achievement in itself   there be a tendency to regard every United Nations resolution as an end in itself and not as a means to an end   in all this there be much room for improvement     it be not basically the Charter that be at fault   though we in Australia would be receptive to change in the Charter if it be think necessary   we must look elsewhere   our distinguished SecretaryGeneral   speak in San Francisco on the twentyfifth anniversary of the signing ceremony   call eloquently on all Member States to   give the Charter a chance    to give it a go and let it succeed     the Foreign Minister of Brazil   in his thoughtful address which open this debate    remind we that   with all its shortcoming and frustration   the United Nations be the only forum in which we can still opt for life   peace and development   as he say   let we use the Organization and let we apply the Charter   we should take this advice to heart     finally   and above all   we must not lose hope in the United Nations   we must not let ourselves drift into cynicism   we should remember at all time the late Dag Hammarskjold s statement    it be not the Soviet Union nor indeed any ether big power who need the United Nations for their protection   it be ail the other   in this sense the Organization be first of all their organization</td>\n",

       "      <td>May I begin by expressing to Ambassador Hambro  on behalf of the delegation of Austria  our best wishes on his election as President of this General Assembly    We derive great satisfaction from the knowledge that this twentyfifth session of the United Nations will be held under the Presidency of a man whom we not only admire as an experienced diplomat  but whose background and personality are so germane to the problems and the respect of international law  This may be quite significant at a time when national and international systems of law are exposed to increased attacks and hard tests    As representatives of a European State  we are also happy to see that this twentyfifth anniversary session of the General Assembly happens to be held under a President from our continent  Starting with the first General Assembly of   which convened under the presidency of that European statesman of genuine greatness PaulHenri Spaak and up to this twentyfifth anniversary session  a chain of outstanding personalities coming from all continents has presided over our Assembly  The President of this session is continuing this illustrious tradition    I also wish to use this opportunity to express the sincere gratitude of the Austrian delegation to Mrs  Angie BrooksRandolph  President of last year s General Assembly    A tragic event of the first magnitude has cast a dark shadow on our deliberations  President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic died suddenly on Monday of this week  In him his own country has lost an outstanding leader and the world a statesman who  by opting for a ceasefire followed by negotiations  rekindled the hopes of millions for a peaceful solution of the Near East conflict  We bow our heads to the memory of a great man and extend our heartfelt sympathy to the people of the United Arab Republic in their great bereavement    The twentyfifth anniversary of the United Nations  which came into being after the end of the Second World War out of a genuine desire to free future generations from the scourge of war  is an occasion to consider what has been achieved and also what has been left undone so far  an occasion to examine our conscience and to ask whether each Member State has really made a due contribution to the peaceful cooperation of the peoples of the world  I believe that it should always be borne in mind that the United Nations can successfully exploit the possibilities open to it by the Charter only within the boundaries set for it by the will of all Member States  and especially by the great Powers    Looking back at the developments of the last twentyfive years one is entitled to ask to what extent have we shown respect for the fundamental principles of international law and acted in the spirit of the Charter  Have we  the States Members of this Organization  really refrained in our international relations from the use or the threat of force against the territorial integrity or the political independence of other States  Have the Member States always settled international disputes by peaceful means and in such a way as not to endanger international security and justice  Has the principle been applied that no State should interfere in the domestic affairs of another State  Has the principle of the equality of sovereign States and their peoples and their right to self determination been observed  And  finally  have the States cited out in good faith the obligations assumed under the United Nations Charter    We must acknowledge  regretfully  that there is a flagrant discrepancy between the present international situation and those principles of the Charter and of international law which should have governed friendly relations among States  While we make speeches here  people are fighting and dying in SouthEast Asia and in the Middle East  Horrible acts of air piracy  kidnapping and murder of innocent hostages are increasing in a frightening way  The rules of international law  the principles of the Charter and human rights are trodden underfoot daily and real or imaginary wrongs are avenged by new lawlessness    I believe that this situation  which is of grave concern  can be resolved only if we find our way back to that deep and sincere desire for peace which filled all the nations of the world at the end of the last great war  and if we make the principles of the United Nations Charter the guideline for our conduct  Just as in the domestic life of a State  mutual tolerance must be exercised in relations between communities  as advocated by Comenius the th anniversary of whose death is being commemorated this year when he said   No State receives internal peace as a free gift  it is the expression of mutual give and take  of self restraint  of freedom based on equal and inalienable rights and the dignity inherent in all men  The same applies to external peace  it will not just drop into one s lap without mutual give and take  selfrestraint and continuous effort     Austria  as a permanently neutral State whose national security is closely linked to international stability  is vitally interested in all measures conducive to the strengthening of international security  accordingly  we welcomed the debate at the twentyfourth session of the General Assembly on the item entitled  Strengthening of international security  and conveyed to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations our position and proposals on that item   To come closer to that objective of international security  it is first necessary to strengthen the United Nations as the most important institution for the preservation of world peace and to support it in the fulfillment of its task  The current anniversary session of the General Assembly provides a welcome opportunity to that end     Peace on our planet will be attainable only if each individual State makes its contribution to that end by endeavoring to solve  in the spirit of the Charter  all problems arising with its neighboring States and within its region    Since Europe  too  is not free of such tensions and since Austria has a natural interest in a detente  it welcomed the recent signing of a treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union as an encouraging beginning  It also welcomed the proposal to hold a conference to deal with questions of security and cooperation in Europe  In a series of bilateral talks with interested States  Austria has endeavored to make its contribution to the creation of a generally acceptable basis for such a conference  Austria has outlined its position in a memorandum addressed to all interested States    A minimum of trust is a prerequisite for all cooperation and the foundation for the success of any conference  The best way to build trust remains the fulfillment of treaties and respect for United Nations resolutions  In this connexion it is a source of great satisfaction for me to be able to report to this Assembly on a problem which  in accordance with two resolutions of the General Assembly  it was possible to move appreciably closer to a solution during the last year  namely  the question of South Tirol    By its resolutions   XV  and   XVI  the General Assembly has called upon Austria and Italy to resume negotiations on the implementation of the Paris Agreement of  September   which regulates the status of the Germanspeaking population of the Province of Bozen and establishes a system designed to guarantee to the Germanspeaking inhabitants of the Province of Bozen  complete equality of rights with the Italianspeaking inhabitants  within the framework of special provisions to safeguard the ethnical character and the cultural and economic development of the Germanspeaking element   The talks were to be resumed with the objective of finding a solution to all differences related to the implementation of the aforementioned agreement    Last year  after nine years of effort  Austria and Italy worked out a proposal for a solution which has received  on a democratic basis  the approval of the elected representatives of the people both in Austria and Italy as well as that of the South Tirolean minority  The two Governments have conveyed this information to the States Members of the United Nations through the SecretaryGeneral in documents A  and A  of  July     While the proposed solution could not be based on a reconciliation between the legal positions of the parties concerned  it provides nevertheless for a number of steps to be taken by the Austrian and Italian sides in accordance with a timetable called  calendar of operations   Within its framework and by means of a constitutional law  ordinary laws  executive regulations to the constitutional law and administrative decrees  Italy committed itself to granting a number of legislative and administrative rights to the province of Bo wn the homeland of the South Tiroleans thus expanding the autonomy of that minority    The administrative decrees provided under this timetable of operations have already been issued  The constitutional law was introduced into the Chamber of Deputies by the Italian Government at the beginning of this year and is now under parliamentary consideration  The ordinary laws should be submitted to the Italian Parliament before the end of this year  It is our sincere hope  and we are encouraged therein by the Government declaration of Prime Minister Colombo on  August   that the parliamentary procedures for the projected legislation will not consume too much time  so that its positive political effects may not be impaired by excessive delay    As soon as the measures enumerated and described in detail in the official annex to the Italian Government declaration of  December   which were noted with approval by the Austrian Parliament at its meeting of  December   and which are to be incorporated in a Constitutional Law  ordinary laws and executive regulations to the Constitutional Law  become legally valid in South Tirol  Austria will declare that it considers as terminated the dispute which was the subject of the aforementioned resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations    Hand in hand with the implementation of measures in favor of the South Tirolean minority in Italy  an agreement between Austria and Italy will be signed and submitted to the ratification procedures and  after completion of these steps  will come into force  This will make the provisions of Chapter  of the European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes applicable  in the relations between Austria and Italy  to disputes concerning the interpretation and implementation of bilateral agreements in force between the two parties  also in those cases where disputes refer to facts or situations prior to the coming into force of the aforementioned European convention between the two States    I am happy to acknowledge that  through the new regulation envisaged for autonomy in South Tirol  a cornerstone was laid for a renewed and fruitful cooperation between the two neighboring countries  Austria and Italy  The Austrian Government is firmly  Signed in Strasbourg on  April  under the auspice   of the Council of Europe  resolved to honor its commitments under the proposed solution  At the same time  it confidently trusts that Italy will make its contribution to the further development of friendly and rewarding relations between our two countries by a speedy implementation  in letter and spirit  of the measures envisaged  and also by following a policy of understanding in respect of the South Tirolean ethnic group  Austria is sincerely interested in such a development    Notwithstanding the efforts by European States to arrive at a lessening of tensions and to achieve closer cooperation  the overall political picture of our world remains clouded  It is an undeniable fact that it has not become possible to put an end to warfare in the Middle East and in SouthEast Asia  or even to reduce the hazards the situation in the Middle East presents to world peace  There was no lack of earnest endeavor from various sides  In particular one has to rate highly the efforts deployed by the great Powers to reach a formula acceptable to all parties for settling the differences in the IsraeliArab conflict  The ceasefire and the renewed search for a political solution to the conflict through the interposition of the United Nations mediator  Ambassador Gunnar Jarring  were overshadowed by the sanguinary battles fought in Jordan  In the long run  however  the only hope for a solution would seem to lie in a settlement of the deeply rooted differences among the peoples of the Middle East by peaceful means  Austria is convinced that the Security Council resolution of  November  points to a way that would lead to a peaceful coexistence of the peoples of that area  a region so rich in cultural heritage and economic potential  Austria is prepared to continue its contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in that area and is also willing  whenever it is deemed desirable  to provide observers or contingents even on a larger scale    The war in VietNam goes on and in the course of this year has even spread over a wider area because of the hostilities in Cambodia  While here  too  efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement and a deescalation of military actions should not be overlooked  we cannot refrain from expressing this year again  our serious concern at the continuation of the armed conflict    We hope that in the face of the continuing human suffering and of the apparent deadlock in this horrible war  all sides will eventually realize that here too a political solution and the use of peaceful means can alone lead to a settlement  a suitable basis for which may be provided by the Geneva Agreements of  and   We have to realize that all planning for the future would be pointless  that we would lack credibility unless we succeeded in settling problems of this scope and urgency    Among the grave problems confronting us  I should now like to point with purpose to those occurrences which not only represent a retreat from the fundamental rules of a civilized world  but which may also become a serious threat to the maintenance of peace  I am referring to the increasingly frequent acts of air piracy and bombing attempts against civil aircraft in flight  as well as to the abuse and even slaughter of innocent hostages to enforce political ends  I agree entirely with SecretaryGeneral U Thant when he calls such acts savage and inhuman and asks for effective international measures to prevent the perpetration and spreading of these crimes    In the light of our interest in the strengthening of international security  Austria follows the development of the disarmament talks with the greatest attention  I should like to express here our satisfaction that the two superPowers found themselves ready to engage in negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons  The fact that the latest phase of these talks was held in Vienna underscores anew the relevance of a permanently neutral State as a venue for such meetings  May I express the hope that the continuation of these talks will lead to concrete agreements whereby the threat of an atomic devastation of our planet would be at least diminished  if not altogether removed    At the same time I should like to emphasize the significance of multilateral disarmament efforts which have worldwide disarmament measures as their objective  The coming into force of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons in march of this year was certainly an important step forward  Austria  one of the first countries to ratify this Treaty  appeals to those States which have not yet decided to do so to accede to it  despite the perhaps not entirely balanced commitments between the nuclear and the nonnuclear States  Austria also welcomed the fact that important tasks relating to the implementation of the Treaty were referred to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna    The complexity of the question of disarmament is directly related to the revolutionary progress in science and technology  It is therefore logical that in the last years the United Nations has increasingly directed its attention to the longrange problems which are closely linked to this technical evolution  I am referring here mainly to the practical applications of space technology which are likely to change our daily life in the future  I should also mention  in this context  the attempts to institute a legal system for outer space and the ocean floor and  last but not least  the efforts of the United Nations to preserve the human environment    Despite an encouraging start in the area of legal arrangements for outer space  a slowdown may now be observed in this work  Nor have the efforts to set forth a declaration of principles for the seabed  so far  achieved the desired goal  This immobility must be overcome because  not only in theoretical but also in practical terms  legislative action of the United Nations in these two fields appears to contribute constructively to the future evolution of the world Organization    The technological  scientific and also political developments of the last decades have made the interdependence of human activity all over the globe even clearer  This is evident in the political and  perhaps even more so  in the economic field  Accordingly  industrial States must take into account   n their economic policies  the interests of the developing countries  The United Nations and its subsidiary agencies on their part should carry out the technical preliminary work necessary for a better understanding of the increasing needs and also for the coordination and execution of the various programs  The Second United Nations Development Decade  approved by the twentyfirst session of the General Assembly and designed to reduce the gap between the poor and the rich by promoting the economic growth of the developing countries  thus acquires particular significance  Austria will make its contribution to the goals of this decade and within the limits of its economic possibilities will in particular make every effort to achieve  during that period  a volume of development assistance equivalent to  per cent of its gross national product    The presence in Vienna of important United Nations institutions  particularly the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  and the holding in our country of numerous international conferences underline once again the importance which we attach to the Development Decade  In this regard I wish to point out that the Austrian Government incurred very substantial expenses to provide UNIDO with fully adequate working premises mainly through new construction and we are proud to note that our efforts in this direction were rewarded by the appreciation expressed from all sides  including the Secretary General    Regarding the establishment of a United Nations   city in Vienna  which would serve as headquarters for the organizations already located there  as well as those that would wish to move to Vienna in future  an international competition of urban architecture has now been completed  The projects selected by the jury are now being examined by the Austrian Government in respect of their feasibility  and it may be expected that a decision on the project to be adopted will be made  in consultation with IAEA and UNIDO  even before the end of this year  Austria hopes that by providing the financial support for this undertaking it will make a further valuable contribution towards the attainment of the objectives of the Development Decade    I should like now to point to two more subjects which  in our view  deserve particular attention on the part of the United Nations  I am referring to the fact that the uses and the significance of data processing in economy  education  administration and science have grown to such an extent that individual States can no longer  by themselves  keep pace with this development  At the same time a situation should be avoided in which  because of higher technical capability  individual States or groups of States acquire a monopoly in this important field  The Austrian Association for Data Processing therefore submitted some time ago a memorandum to SecretaryGeneral U Thant  which contains a proposal for the setting up of a central service for the processing and exchange of data within the United Nations framework and which  in addition to the processing of the material  would also have the task of carrying out an objective evaluation of all the data on the basis of unified standards  thus preventing possible manipulations    The second thought I wanted to submit is that  in view of the continuously increasing demands on national administrations and on the secretariats of international organizations  the problem of the auditing of these administrations acquires a growing significance  Austria is happy to be host in Vienna to the International Secretariat of the Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions  which has set itself the task of promoting principles of efficient administrative controls through periodic exchange of experience  In accordance with a wish often expressed by developing countries a seminar has been planned within the framework of that Organization s activities  to be conducted in Austria in the spring of   with assistance from the United Nations Development Program  which will deal with State audit problems at the highest level  with particular emphasis on problems peculiar to developing countries    In conclusion  I should like to go back once again to the phenomenon of the increasing acts of violence occurring both in international and national life  According to Art   paragraph  of the Charter  the primary purpose of the United Nations is to settle international disputes and situations which may lead to a breach of peace by peaceful means and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law  It would therefore be correct to say that the United Nations is built on the principle of  peace through law     The external peace to be ensured in accordance with that principle necessarily implies internal peace within the members of the family of nations as its prerequisite  That internal peace cannot exist  in the long run  inside a State which does not respect the fundamental rights of the person  which are also consecrated by the Charter of the United Nations  Human rights and fundamental freedoms can no longer be exclusively regarded today as the classic rights which we may find in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of  December     The principle of the equality of all men has since been expanded by the codifying activities of the United Nations  aimed at preventing all forms of racial discrimination  Discrimination based on the color of the skin or on ethnic origin  such as we find it today in particular in southern Africa  is therefore liable to compromise external peace  The Austrian Government has repeatedly stated that it rejects the concept of apartheid  which is contrary to the Charter  just as it rejects every other political concept based on racial  religious or ethnic discrimination  I wish to restate this position of ours most emphatically and to stress  in this context  that in the opinion of Austria  the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa  which was endorsed by the twentyfourth General Assembly  points to a practicable way towards the implementation of the Declaration on decolonization adopted ten years ago    The developments in southern Africa are the more alarming since the discriminatory policies  condemned by the whole world  are spreading to an area which by virtue of decisions of this Organization had been placed under the direct responsibility of the United Nations  The inhabitants of Namibia must be given the right freely to determine their future  just as all the other peoples of the world    In connexion with this problem we welcome the decision of the Security Council reflected in its resolution     of  July   which requests an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice regarding  the legal consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia  notwithstanding Security Council resolution       One hopes that the advisory opinion to be handed down by the International Court of Justice will bring this Organization one step nearer to the solution of the Namibian problem    In this connexion  it would seem appropriate for me to say a few words about the International Court itself  We believe that the proposals submitted to the General Assembly to review the role of the Court deserve close study  Those proposals are designed to expand the sphere of action of the Court  and in that context more emphasis could be placed on the concept of the peaceful settlement of disputes  Especially interesting is the idea of setting up regional chambers of the Court which could be used for the settlement of disputes within a given region  To stress the significance which Austria attaches to the role of the International Court of Justice  I should like to state here that the Federal Government of Austria has decided  during these last days  to introduce a bill in Parliament which would provide for the issuance of a declaration under Article   paragraph   of the Statute of the International Court of Justice  according to which Austria will recognize the jurisdiction of the Court as  compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement  in relation to any other State accepting the same obligation     I have focused my remarks more specifically on the aspects of international security and the maintenance of law and order in the world  This in no way means that we underrate the significance of other problems  I am  however  firmly convinced that a firm rededication by all Member States to the principle of friendly relations and cooperation among nations would be an essential step to bring us nearer to peace and to the solution of all pending problems    We must learn from the past that peace  justice and progress form an indivisible whole and constitute as such the condition sine qua non for the survival of mankind</td>\n",
       "      <td>may I begin by express to Ambassador Hambro   on behalf of the delegation of Austria   our good wish on his election as President of this General Assembly     we derive great satisfaction from the knowledge that this twentyfifth session of the United Nations will be hold under the Presidency of a man whom we not only admire as an experienced diplomat   but whose background and personality be so germane to the problem and the respect of international law   this may be quite significant at a time when national and international system of law be expose to increase attack and hard test     as representative of a European State   we be also happy to see that this twentyfifth anniversary session of the General Assembly happen to be hold under a President from our continent   start with the first General Assembly of    which convene under the presidency of that european statesman of genuine greatness PaulHenri Spaak and up to this twentyfifth anniversary session   a chain of outstanding personality come from all continent have preside over our Assembly   the President of this session be continue this illustrious tradition     I also wish to use this opportunity to express the sincere gratitude of the austrian delegation to Mrs   Angie BrooksRandolph   President of last year s General Assembly     a tragic event of the first magnitude have cast a dark shadow on our deliberation   President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic die suddenly on Monday of this week   in he his own country have lose an outstanding leader and the world a statesman who   by opt for a ceasefire follow by negotiation   rekindle the hope of million for a peaceful solution of the Near East conflict   we bow our head to the memory of a great man and extend our heartfelt sympathy to the people of the United Arab Republic in their great bereavement     the twentyfifth anniversary of the United Nations   which come into be after the end of the Second World War out of a genuine desire to free future generation from the scourge of war   be an occasion to consider what have be achieve and also what have be leave undone so far   an occasion to examine our conscience and to ask whether each Member State have really make a due contribution to the peaceful cooperation of the people of the world   I believe that it should always be bear in mind that the United Nations can successfully exploit the possibility open to it by the Charter only within the boundary set for it by the will of all Member States   and especially by the great Powers     look back at the development of the last twentyfive year one be entitle to ask to what extent have we show respect for the fundamental principle of international law and act in the spirit of the Charter   have we   the States Members of this Organization   really refrain in our international relation from the use or the threat of force against the territorial integrity or the political independence of other States   have the Member States always settle international dispute by peaceful mean and in such a way as not to endanger international security and justice   have the principle be apply that no state should interfere in the domestic affair of another State   have the principle of the equality of sovereign States and their people and their right to self determination be observe   and   finally   have the States cite out in good faith the obligation assume under the United Nations Charter     we must acknowledge   regretfully   that there be a flagrant discrepancy between the present international situation and those principle of the Charter and of international law which should have govern friendly relation among States   while we make speech here   people be fight and die in SouthEast Asia and in the Middle East   horrible act of air piracy   kidnapping and murder of innocent hostage be increase in a frightening way   the rule of international law   the principle of the Charter and human right be trodden underfoot daily and real or imaginary wrong be avenge by new lawlessness     I believe that this situation   which be of grave concern   can be resolve only if we find our way back to that deep and sincere desire for peace which fill all the nation of the world at the end of the last great war   and if we make the principle of the United Nations Charter the guideline for our conduct   just as in the domestic life of a State   mutual tolerance must be exercise in relation between community   as advocate by Comenius the th anniversary of whose death be be commemorate this year when he say    no State receive internal peace as a free gift   it be the expression of mutual give and take   of self restraint   of freedom base on equal and inalienable right and the dignity inherent in all man   the same apply to external peace   it will not just drop into one s lap without mutual give and take   selfrestraint and continuous effort      Austria   as a permanently neutral state whose national security be closely link to international stability   be vitally interested in all measure conducive to the strengthening of international security   accordingly   we welcome the debate at the twentyfourth session of the General Assembly on the item entitle   strengthening of international security   and convey to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations our position and proposal on that item    to come close to that objective of international security   it be first necessary to strengthen the United Nations as the most important institution for the preservation of world peace and to support it in the fulfillment of its task   the current anniversary session of the General Assembly provide a welcome opportunity to that end      peace on our planet will be attainable only if each individual state make its contribution to that end by endeavor to solve   in the spirit of the Charter   all problem arise with its neighboring state and within its region     since Europe   too   be not free of such tension and since Austria have a natural interest in a detente   it welcome the recent signing of a treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union as an encouraging begin   it also welcome the proposal to hold a conference to deal with question of security and cooperation in Europe   in a series of bilateral talk with interested States   Austria have endeavor to make its contribution to the creation of a generally acceptable basis for such a conference   Austria have outline its position in a memorandum address to all interested States     a minimum of trust be a prerequisite for all cooperation and the foundation for the success of any conference   the good way to build trust remain the fulfillment of treaty and respect for United Nations resolution   in this connexion it be a source of great satisfaction for I to be able to report to this Assembly on a problem which   in accordance with two resolution of the General Assembly   it be possible to move appreciably close to a solution during the last year   namely   the question of South Tirol     by its resolution    XV   and    XVI   the General Assembly have call upon Austria and Italy to resume negotiation on the implementation of the Paris Agreement of   September    which regulate the status of the germanspeake population of the Province of Bozen and establish a system design to guarantee to the Germanspeaking inhabitant of the Province of Bozen   complete equality of right with the italianspeaking inhabitant   within the framework of special provision to safeguard the ethnical character and the cultural and economic development of the Germanspeaking element    the talk be to be resume with the objective of find a solution to all difference relate to the implementation of the aforementioned agreement     last year   after nine year of effort   Austria and Italy work out a proposal for a solution which have receive   on a democratic basis   the approval of the elect representative of the people both in Austria and Italy as well as that of the South tirolean minority   the two government have convey this information to the States Members of the United Nations through the SecretaryGeneral in document a   and a   of   July      while the propose solution could not be base on a reconciliation between the legal position of the party concern   it provide nevertheless for a number of step to be take by the austrian and italian side in accordance with a timetable call   calendar of operation    within its framework and by mean of a constitutional law   ordinary law   executive regulation to the constitutional law and administrative decree   Italy commit itself to grant a number of legislative and administrative right to the province of Bo wn the homeland of the South Tiroleans thus expand the autonomy of that minority     the administrative decree provide under this timetable of operation have already be issue   the constitutional law be introduce into the Chamber of Deputies by the italian Government at the beginning of this year and be now under parliamentary consideration   the ordinary law should be submit to the italian Parliament before the end of this year   it be our sincere hope   and we be encourage therein by the Government declaration of Prime Minister Colombo on   August    that the parliamentary procedure for the project legislation will not consume too much time   so that its positive political effect may not be impair by excessive delay     as soon as the measure enumerate and describe in detail in the official annex to the italian Government declaration of   December    which be note with approval by the Austrian Parliament at its meeting of   December    and which be to be incorporate in a Constitutional Law   ordinary law and executive regulation to the Constitutional Law   become legally valid in South Tirol   Austria will declare that it consider as terminate the dispute which be the subject of the aforementioned resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations     Hand in hand with the implementation of measure in favor of the South tirolean minority in Italy   an agreement between Austria and Italy will be sign and submit to the ratification procedure and   after completion of these step   will come into force   this will make the provision of chapter   of the European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes applicable   in the relation between Austria and Italy   to dispute concern the interpretation and implementation of bilateral agreement in force between the two party   also in those case where dispute refer to fact or situation prior to the come into force of the aforementioned european convention between the two States     I be happy to acknowledge that   through the new regulation envisage for autonomy in South Tirol   a cornerstone be lay for a renew and fruitful cooperation between the two neighboring country   Austria and Italy   the Austrian Government be firmly   sign in Strasbourg on   April   under the auspice    of the Council of Europe   resolve to honor its commitment under the propose solution   at the same time   it confidently trust that Italy will make its contribution to the further development of friendly and rewarding relation between our two country by a speedy implementation   in letter and spirit   of the measure envisage   and also by follow a policy of understanding in respect of the South Tirolean ethnic group   Austria be sincerely interested in such a development     notwithstanding the effort by European States to arrive at a lessening of tension and to achieve close cooperation   the overall political picture of our world remain clouded   it be an undeniable fact that it have not become possible to put an end to warfare in the Middle East and in SouthEast Asia   or even to reduce the hazard the situation in the Middle East present to world peace   there be no lack of earnest endeavor from various side   in particular one have to rate highly the effort deploy by the great Powers to reach a formula acceptable to all party for settle the difference in the IsraeliArab conflict   the ceasefire and the renew search for a political solution to the conflict through the interposition of the United Nations mediator   Ambassador Gunnar Jarring   be overshadow by the sanguinary battle fight in Jordan   in the long run   however   the only hope for a solution would seem to lie in a settlement of the deeply root difference among the people of the Middle East by peaceful mean   Austria be convince that the Security Council resolution of   November   point to a way that would lead to a peaceful coexistence of the people of that area   a region so rich in cultural heritage and economic potential   Austria be prepared to continue its contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in that area and be also willing   whenever it be deem desirable   to provide observer or contingent even on a large scale     the war in VietNam go on and in the course of this year have even spread over a wide area because of the hostility in Cambodia   while here   too   effort aim at a peaceful settlement and a deescalation of military action should not be overlook   we can not refrain from express this year again   our serious concern at the continuation of the armed conflict     we hope that in the face of the continue human suffering and of the apparent deadlock in this horrible war   all side will eventually realize that here too a political solution and the use of peaceful mean can alone lead to a settlement   a suitable basis for which may be provide by the Geneva Agreements of   and    we have to realize that all plan for the future would be pointless   that we would lack credibility unless we succeed in settle problem of this scope and urgency     among the grave problem confront we   I should now like to point with purpose to those occurrence which not only represent a retreat from the fundamental rule of a civilized world   but which may also become a serious threat to the maintenance of peace   I be refer to the increasingly frequent act of air piracy and bombing attempt against civil aircraft in flight   as well as to the abuse and even slaughter of innocent hostage to enforce political end   I agree entirely with SecretaryGeneral U Thant when he call such act savage and inhuman and ask for effective international measure to prevent the perpetration and spread of these crime     in the light of our interest in the strengthening of international security   Austria follow the development of the disarmament talk with the great attention   I should like to express here our satisfaction that the two superpower find themselves ready to engage in negotiation on the limitation of strategic weapon   the fact that the late phase of these talk be hold in Vienna underscore anew the relevance of a permanently neutral state as a venue for such meeting   may I express the hope that the continuation of these talk will lead to concrete agreement whereby the threat of an atomic devastation of our planet would be at least diminish   if not altogether remove     at the same time I should like to emphasize the significance of multilateral disarmament effort which have worldwide disarmament measure as their objective   the come into force of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons in march of this year be certainly an important step forward   Austria   one of the first country to ratify this Treaty   appeal to those state which have not yet decide to do so to accede to it   despite the perhaps not entirely balance commitment between the nuclear and the nonnuclear States   Austria also welcome the fact that important task relate to the implementation of the Treaty be refer to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna     the complexity of the question of disarmament be directly relate to the revolutionary progress in science and technology   it be therefore logical that in the last year the United Nations have increasingly direct its attention to the longrange problem which be closely link to this technical evolution   I be refer here mainly to the practical application of space technology which be likely to change our daily life in the future   I should also mention   in this context   the attempt to institute a legal system for outer space and the ocean floor and   last but not least   the effort of the United Nations to preserve the human environment     despite an encouraging start in the area of legal arrangement for outer space   a slowdown may now be observe in this work   nor have the effort to set forth a declaration of principle for the seabed   so far   achieve the desire goal   this immobility must be overcome because   not only in theoretical but also in practical term   legislative action of the United Nations in these two field appear to contribute constructively to the future evolution of the world Organization     the technological   scientific and also political development of the last decade have make the interdependence of human you all over the globe even clear   this be evident in the political and   perhaps even more so   in the economic field   accordingly   industrial States must take into account    n their economic policy   the interest of the develop country   the United Nations and its subsidiary agency on their part should carry out the technical preliminary work necessary for a well understanding of the increase need and also for the coordination and execution of the various program   the Second United Nations Development Decade   approve by the twentyfirst session of the General Assembly and design to reduce the gap between the poor and the rich by promote the economic growth of the develop country   thus acquire particular significance   Austria will make its contribution to the goal of this decade and within the limit of its economic possibility will in particular make every effort to achieve   during that period   a volume of development assistance equivalent to   per cent of its gross national product     the presence in Vienna of important United Nations institution   particularly the United Nations Industrial Development Organization   and the holding in our country of numerous international conference underline once again the importance which we attach to the Development Decade   in this regard I wish to point out that the Austrian Government incur very substantial expense to provide UNIDO with fully adequate working premise mainly through new construction and we be proud to note that our effort in this direction be reward by the appreciation express from all side   include the Secretary General     regard the establishment of a United Nations    city in Vienna   which would serve as headquarters for the organization already locate there   as well as those that would wish to move to Vienna in future   an international competition of urban architecture have now be complete   the project select by the jury be now be examine by the Austrian Government in respect of their feasibility   and it may be expect that a decision on the project to be adopt will be make   in consultation with IAEA and UNIDO   even before the end of this year   Austria hope that by provide the financial support for this undertaking it will make a further valuable contribution towards the attainment of the objective of the Development Decade     I should like now to point to two more subject which   in our view   deserve particular attention on the part of the United Nations   I be refer to the fact that the use and the significance of datum processing in economy   education   administration and science have grow to such an extent that individual States can no long   by themselves   keep pace with this development   at the same time a situation should be avoid in which   because of high technical capability   individual state or group of state acquire a monopoly in this important field   the Austrian Association for Data Processing therefore submit some time ago a memorandum to SecretaryGeneral U Thant   which contain a proposal for the setting up of a central service for the processing and exchange of datum within the United Nations framework and which   in addition to the processing of the material   would also have the task of carry out an objective evaluation of all the datum on the basis of unified standard   thus prevent possible manipulation     the second thought I want to submit be that   in view of the continuously increase demand on national administration and on the secretariat of international organization   the problem of the auditing of these administration acquire a grow significance   Austria be happy to be host in Vienna to the International Secretariat of the Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions   which have set itself the task of promote principle of efficient administrative control through periodic exchange of experience   in accordance with a wish often express by develop country a seminar have be plan within the framework of that Organization s activity   to be conduct in Austria in the spring of    with assistance from the United Nations Development Program   which will deal with state audit problem at the high level   with particular emphasis on problem peculiar to develop country     in conclusion   I should like to go back once again to the phenomenon of the increase act of violence occur both in international and national life   accord to art    paragraph   of the Charter   the primary purpose of the United Nations be to settle international dispute and situation which may lead to a breach of peace by peaceful mean and in conformity with the principle of justice and international law   it would therefore be correct to say that the United Nations be build on the principle of   peace through law      the external peace to be ensure in accordance with that principle necessarily imply internal peace within the member of the family of nation as its prerequisite   that internal peace can not exist   in the long run   inside a state which do not respect the fundamental right of the person   which be also consecrate by the Charter of the United Nations   human right and fundamental freedom can no long be exclusively regard today as the classic right which we may find in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of   December      the principle of the equality of all man have since be expand by the codify activity of the United Nations   aim at prevent all form of racial discrimination   discrimination base on the color of the skin or on ethnic origin   such as we find it today in particular in southern Africa   be therefore liable to compromise external peace   the austrian Government have repeatedly state that it reject the concept of apartheid   which be contrary to the Charter   just as it reject every other political concept base on racial   religious or ethnic discrimination   I wish to restate this position of ours most emphatically and to stress   in this context   that in the opinion of Austria   the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa   which be endorse by the twentyfourth General Assembly   point to a practicable way towards the implementation of the Declaration on decolonization adopt ten year ago     the development in southern Africa be the more alarming since the discriminatory policy   condemn by the whole world   be spread to an area which by virtue of decision of this Organization have be place under the direct responsibility of the United Nations   the inhabitant of Namibia must be give the right freely to determine their future   just as all the other people of the world     in connexion with this problem we welcome the decision of the Security Council reflect in its resolution      of   July    which request an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice regard   the legal consequence for States of the continue presence of South Africa in Namibia   notwithstanding Security Council resolution        one hope that the advisory opinion to be hand down by the International Court of Justice will bring this Organization one step near to the solution of the namibian problem     in this connexion   it would seem appropriate for I to say a few word about the International Court itself   we believe that the proposal submit to the General Assembly to review the role of the Court deserve close study   those proposal be design to expand the sphere of action of the Court   and in that context more emphasis could be place on the concept of the peaceful settlement of dispute   especially interesting be the idea of set up regional chamber of the Court which could be use for the settlement of dispute within a give region   to stress the significance which Austria attach to the role of the International Court of Justice   I should like to state here that the Federal Government of Austria have decide   during these last day   to introduce a bill in Parliament which would provide for the issuance of a declaration under Article    paragraph    of the Statute of the International Court of Justice   accord to which Austria will recognize the jurisdiction of the Court as   compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement   in relation to any other state accept the same obligation      I have focus my remark more specifically on the aspect of international security and the maintenance of law and order in the world   this in no way mean that we underrate the significance of other problem   I be   however   firmly convince that a firm rededication you all Member States to the principle of friendly relation and cooperation among nation would be an essential step to bring we near to peace and to the solution of all pende problem     we must learn from the past that peace   justice and progress form an indivisible whole and constitute as such the condition sine qua non for the

       "      <td>No doubt each of us  before coming up to this rostrum  wonders about the usefulness or futility of the speech  Must we still speak when our voices are drowned out by the mournful cries of so many victims of the world s disorders  Our reply is yes  provided that  in listening to each other  we become more deeply convinced of our responsibilities  For our part  we shall not extol the successes of the United Nations  nor shall we allow ourselves to be discouraged by its failures  A worldwide order of peace and justice cannot be built in  years    Is it not important in itself that our Organization  conceived in a very different moment of history  has withstood the changes wrought by a single quarter century    In   no one doubts that the United Nations is necessary  On the contrary  people want it to be effective    It seems to us that one thing should encourage us all  It is the fact that in our countries  in mine as in may others  the great principles  of the Charter are impressing themselves more and more on consciences and especially on the consciences of the young  On the one hand we see that in most of our countries many convictions are crumbling  but on the other hand we find stronger support than existed  years ago for the five choices made by our States in   Indeed there is  and particularly among the younger members of our population  an immediate response to the duty to organize collective security  the duty to disarm  the duty to ensure the equitable distribution of goods among all peoples  respect for human rights  and the settlement by arbitration or judicial process of legal disputes between States    All these aims  in our country and in many others  are becoming more and more sacred  imperative and urgent  the failure to observe these principles grows more shocking  and we are therefore urged to hasten the time when these principles and duties will be fulfilled throughout the world    Our response to this expectation is twofold  as we see it  the aims of the United Nations must be tackled on all fronts and  whenever possible  at several levels not only by the central institutions of the United Nations  but also by numerous regional actions    We do not propose the establishment of new institutions  but rather the adaptation and enhancement of those we already have    First of ail we wish and I am saying first of all to strengthen the central institutions of the United Nations  especially for the purpose of achieving two of their main purposes  security and development    Whatever contributes towards making the Security Council more effective will have our support  My country was one of the sponsors of the draft resolution on international security  submitted in the First Committee  which  inter alia  contains specific proposals for strengthening the authority of the Council  But I fully realize that these proposals will not achieve their purpose unless  beforehand  all States Members of our Organization reaffirm their political will to accept and implement the decisions of the Council  in accordance with Article  of the Charter    Furthermore  in specific  limited fields  the Charter delegates to the Security Council real powers  and this  as we see it  foreshadows a world executive in a way  But here  should not the General Assembly support the Council  To that end  we would be in favor of the General Assembly  within the context of Article  of the Charter  pronouncing itself on the action of the Security Council  and hence of its closely studying the annual report of the Council    We also wish to emphasize the importance of the meeting of the Security Council provided for in paragraph  of Article  of the Charter  which should be held in the course of the work of the present session of the General Assembly  We have strongly supported that action in previous years and now reaffirm our support    So much for the field of security  The same holds true with regard to development  We believe that the time is coming when a certain power of decision will have to be vested in a world executive  It is no longer sufficient for the Economic and Social Council or the General Assembly simply to set development targets  some poverty will not be avoided unless  in specific cases  some authority can enforce the necessary action in time  For the purpose of restoring peace  does not the Charter confer such powers on the Security Council  And sometimes the Council exercises them  The same need exists where hunger or underdevelopment are involved    Accordingly  we believe that we are faced with the problem of the exercise of the central authority of the United Nations and of strengthening this Organization    Of course  the question of strengthening the authority of the United Nations also embraces the question of its universality  We welcome the fact that in a quarter of a century the sovereignty of so many formerly dependent territories has been recognized and their admission to membership in the United Nations guarantees it  Such is the irreversible trend of decolonization  But the problem of universality presents itself in another way  Some peoples are represented here only in part or not at all  Their absence is not conducive to peace or to peaceful relations between States  The time is not very far off  we believe  when we will be able to adopt an attitude more consistent with our principles  To achieve this  we must overcome the difficulties which still persist  especially with regard to China    In this particular case  my country has consistently urged  for five years  a solution that would enable the representatives of the Government of the People s Republic of China a State which we recognize to occupy the seat which belongs to China in the General Assembly and in the Security Council  This solution cannot jeopardize the right of the representatives of the Government of the Republic of Taiwan to continue to enjoy the protection of our Charter  and therefore to participate in the work of the United Nations  This is  we believe  the only possibility  until a peaceful settlement enables the dispute between these two Chinese Governments to be composed  We also believe that the peaceful settlement of that dispute would thereby be facilitated    My country regrets that a large number of States have informed us that they do not yet share our view  and we therefore did not wish to express it this year in the form of a draft resolution  But  on the other hand  so far  no one has convinced us that any other attitude would be both more just and more consistent with the Charter  We shall continue our consultations with other Governments in seeking the urgent solution which this important problem demands    We therefore attach the greatest importance to strengthening the central power of the United Nations and to its universality  but we hold it to be equally true that the purposes of the Charter can be successfully achieved  although in part  by means of regional arrangements or organizations  deriving from the spontaneous action of countries grouped together in a given area one action does not exclude the other  one action adding to the other  the one aiding the other    The idea is hardly revolutionary  It is suggested in many parts of the Charter and it has already been put into effect in part but in our opinion  at this time in history  it deserves further reflection and a new impetus  The reasons for this effort can  we think  be formulated in a few proposals    Let us make use of this need  which has become evident and is relatively recent  which compels most States to have recourse to interState  organizations in order to solve their economic  social  communications  supply  market  cultural  scientific and defense problems  which today separate nations can as a rule no longer master by themselves    This necessity for interdependence which is relatively recent  I repeat has created the need today for new regional links of solidarity  These are natural  they are becoming more and more closely knit  each is formed differently by a complex of historical and geographical factors  similarities of human environment  identical needs and aspirations  related political regimes and philosophies  We believe th t we must make use of this natural movement    We must therefore imbue these new institutions with the spirit of the Charter and  in each case  examine whether they cannot constitute  in turn  an initial framework which encompasses the purposes of the United Nations and tries to achieve them first in a regional context  Perhaps some obstacles which impede the power of decision of the Security Council might now be offset by this method    The regional organizations  too  will  of course  remain incomplete and partly prevented from fulfilling their objectives    But if the purposes of the United Nations are thus pursued from the ground to the top and from top to bottom  if the complementarity of action is ensured and  if  of course  the world bodies still have the last word in the event of conflicting policies  then we can hope for a greater measure of overall success in pursuing the purposes of the Charter    Those are the reasons which  in the light of experience  prompt us to cooperate eagerly I am speaking of Belgium in the world organizations and in their decentralized activities and also to participate actively in our region  Europe  in promoting links of regional solidarity and interdependence    That will provide a better understanding of some of the attitudes adopted by my country with regard to the present items and  first of all  I turn to the problems of security    The more than  States which share the territory of Europe cannot forget that in the past  years they have unleashed more wars than the other continents  and that two of them have set the world on fire  As if this were not enough  a cold war has been dividing them for the past quarter of a century  Why has this new situation of conflict not led to a third world war  Because  we believe  very soon and very fortunately bonds of solidarity and interdependence began to create balanced situations  certain transnational groupings in Europe which  due to the cohesion they have acquired and that will be developed further  make possible today the efforts gradually to reduce tensions and then to foster understanding    We have therefore asked ourselves whether  some day  security arrangements of the kind provided for in Article  of the Charter might bring about and guarantee harmony in the territories of the whole of Europe through the establishment of rules and instruments of agreement  conciliation and arbitration of disputes  Here it must be made quite clear that such arrangements can be no substitute for our existing economic solidarity and I am referring to the European Economic Communities or for the existing defense organizations that is  the Atlantic Alliance but they should supplement them  Similarly  if a security agreement for the whole of Europe were to be concluded some day  nor would it replace the task of the Security Council  but would remain subordinated to it through the links provided for in Article  of the Charter    Finally  let us say it  a regional organization for the security of the whole of Europe cannot be achieved so long as there is no political agreement on Berlin  no rules accepted by all on the real equality of States  and so long as the principle of noninterference in the affairs of others is not upheld in practice  Events of only too recent memory show that transitional steps are necessary to temper power politics by establishing collective security  It is therefore necessary  in our opinion  to seek to have such regional security agreements for Europe  not as an immediately obtainable objective  but as an ultimate end to be reached only step by step    It is on the road to European regional security that the time is coming when efforts must be made to endeavor to achieve the first intermediate objectives which would in themselves have farreaching implications  Let the bilateral agreements on economic and social cooperation between countries with different systems become multilateral  let us seek to have the covenants renouncing the use of force  such as the one recently signed by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  apply to Europe as a whole    But for such intermediary agreements to be really credible  the negotiations themselves should at the same time make it possible to establish at least the principles and general outlines of a gradual and parallel reduction in regional armaments in Europe  both those stationed there and national armaments  And that leads us to the second problem  disarmament    What purpose does it really serve to declare solemnly that we renounce the use of force  if we continue to pile up the instruments of force  It follows that the renunciation of force and the reduction of armaments are two indivisible elements    Certainly the problem of disarmament has already been raised at the world level  but since we want the coming decade to be that of disarmament  it would be worth while to pursue this aim at several levels  the negotiations of the  at Geneva have borne some fruit  the bilateral socalled SALT negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union do not seem to be ineffective    But what can and should Europe do  Europe which harbors so many tactical and conventional means of destruction  Should it take regional steps to disarm  For a long time now Belgium has strongly believed that it should  and is prepared to participate in such negotiations  in which the United States and Canada would of necessity have to be parties too  We hope that such negotiations will be possible as soon as the practical and wellknown conditions for the ratification in Bonn of the GermanSoviet Treaty have been met  and provided nothing else transpires to darken this horizon  Then the active preparation of initial conferences on European security could be organized  We will contribute  as in the past  to this first approach to regional security    The second area in which central and regional actions can be combined without being merged  but complement each other  is development    We have spoken about the Disarmament Decade  It will also be the Development Decade  The two are not unrelated  The strategy for the Second Development Decade has already been discussed at length and formulated  and in this context the volume and terms of the financial aid for development are particularly noteworthy    That is why Belgium is happy to be able to announce that its total aid will exceed  per cent of its gross national product in   as in previous years  Moreover  it wishes to stress that its public aid rose  per cent in   and  per cent in   which placed it fourth among the industrialized countries  This public aid will further increase in   by  per cent    Lastly  and above all  the Belgian Government  mindful of the needs and hopes of the developing countries  decided on  September   a few days ago  to place before Parliament a Program under which public aid would in  reach the figure of   per cent of that year s gross national product  This decision is a milestone in our policy  but its scope will be very limited unless it forms part of a joint effort by the industrialized countries    As we know very well  a common effort should not be focused only on the financing of development  It should encompass trade policy  a commodities price policy and support for the developing country s own efforts in all areas  especially that of regional cooperation and integration  This will in all likelihood require revision and adaptation of the process of world discussion    We believe furthermore that here again regional initiatives can  through individual arrangements with certain developing countries  add a dimension and a form of particularly effective mutual cooperation  I am thinking of the European communities which  through the Yaounde Convention and the Arusha Declaration of January  and through aid to associated European countries  make a contribution which  in some fields  supplements and increases the effects of bilateral assistance    As regards Latin America  we view with sympathy the efforts at progressive integration of the States of that part of the world  and we particularly welcome the spirit which  at the last meeting of the Special Commission for Latin American coordination in July  motivated the Buenos Aires Declaration on the problems of relations with the European Economic Communities    In turn Belgium hopes that the European Com munites  as they develop and expand  will be able to give Western Europe a new image  It will not be one of hegemony  it cannot be one of neutrality  it will not be one of dependency  What  then  would be the attitude of Europe  in the process of unification  to the world  None other than one of intensive cooperation in the development of the southern hemisphere    Today we must make provision for the economic and social restoration and rehabilitation of the regions affected by the conflict in the Middle East  In that particular case my country is well aware that no real solution will be forthcoming as long as the Palestinian refugees have no home nor the economic means for their development    Belgium announces that it will participate in any European plan for rehabilitating the devastated areas which will enable those refugees to settle in a stable and happy environment  We have submitted to the European agencies the plan drawn up for this purpose by a Committee headed by the President of the Belgian Senate  Once formulated  a Program of European cooperation would help the parties to the conflict in their search for peace    On a more immediate and completely bilateral level  in swift response to the moving appeal of our President and of the SecretaryGeneral  the Belgian Government immediately decided  a few days ago  to make a very substantial contribution in aid for the many victims of the recent events in Jordan    More generally  I cannot speak of the conflict in the Middle East without once again reaffirming the Belgian Government s wholehearted support for all diplomatic efforts aimed at ensuring the swift and full implementation of the Security Council s resolution of  November    Unfortunately  three years have already gone by since the essential conditions for a political settlement of the Middle East question were laid down  We venture to hope that both the spirit and the letter of the ceasefire agreement of  August last  which we welcomed as a happy event  will be respected by the parties concerned  We are anxious to see the early resumption of the talks initiated by Ambassador Jarring    We have just dealt with subjects of collective security  disarmament and cooperation for development  and we noted that the convergence of actions at the world level and of regional initiatives could bring closer the time when the purposes of our Charter will be more effectively fulfilled    Similar thoughts come to mind too in connexion with human rights  economic and social cooperation and international justice    True  when we speak about the protection of the human person  it would be impossible to guarantee safety from certain evil practices only through international agreements or regulations  and I have in mind here particularly the present crimes of hijacking and the detention or execution of diplomats  In regard to the former  my country will put forward its suggestions at the diplomatic conference to be held in December at The Hague and  for the international protection of diplomats  consuls and ministers  it advocates the urgent convening of an ad hoc diplomatic conference    But when we envisage a more general approach to the question of respect for human rights  here again we find an example of cases where regional action can supplement that of our General Assembly  We recall that in  we drew up here  for the whole world  a Universal Declaration of Human Rights    But we can go further in the definition and protection of human rights when regional communities of States allow themselves to be motivated by a stable democratic conscience which is expressed therein  Eighteen European countries did so in   by drawing up the European Charter of Human Rights and  in addition  by setting up a European court on human rights to which individuals can have recourse when their rights are challenged  Several States  including Belgium  in the past already felt it an honor to amend their national legislation at the request of the Court to bring it into line with the decisions of that Court    The same will apply to economic and social cooperation  The United Nations already has instruments of regional cooperation  It is in the regional economic commissions that the ideas of integration were born  which took shape in Latin America and are striving to emerge in Africa  It was on their initiative that development banks were founded  it was they who launched numerous projects in the most varied fields from industry to agriculture  and from natural resources to transportation    Nevertheless  we would like those commissions henceforth to play an even greater role  so as to achieve the goals of the Second Development Decade  especially in the formulation of plans and the evaluation of progress    As far as the Economic Commission for Europe is concerned  it already plays a leading role in coordinating the efforts made  with a view to improving goodneighborly relations among European States  as we read in resolution   XX   In this context or elsewhere  we think that in Europe the time has come to embark on a frank and thorough review of relations between the groupings of the market economy countries and the Stateeconomy countries    The last subject in regard to central action and regional action is that of international justice  Indeed  in that field we also see that in some cases regional initiative or action are possible  that is described in Article  of the Charter which advocates the settlement of disputes between States by way of good offices  mediation  conciliation and arbitration  That Article provides that those actions can be carried out by regional agencies  The Organization of African Unity has established this type of machinery under the Charter  and we believe this to be a good thing    True  the International Court of Justice   the supreme tribunal in legal disputes and must  in the final analysis  guarantee the universality of international law  However  here again we cannot forget that States parties to regional legal disputes may  by virtue of the Statutes of the Court itself  Article   paragraph   ask that chambers be formed for dealing with a particular case  For such cases  and if the question of reactivating the International Court of Justice is looked into further  as requested by the United States  Belgium will submit to it the question whether  in particular cases and on very precisely determined occasions  regional ad hoc chambers could be formed  while at the same time upholding the universal character of the United Nations and the universality of international law    My country has not been developing an abstract thesis today nor has it claimed that regional initiatives are some kind of panacea for the world  We are merely convinced that the spirit of the Charter can and must manifest itself in many places  and that we must not expect everything from initiatives at the world level  nor of course can we expect everything from regional initiatives  however  if they supplement one another  we may find herein a source of progress or initiatives which are being taken in different places    We have noted that the past  years especially in Europe but also in Africa  Latin America and the Middle East have been characterized by the emergence of numerous regional bodies and firm multilateral ties  To be sound and lasting  these must always be spontaneous and leave each people free to be associated with them  to be excellent  they must draw their inspiration from the principles of the Charter and seek  within that context also  to further their progress  By adding that dimension to our efforts  we have noted  it is possible to increase the opportunities for collective security  disarmament  cooperation for development  respect for human rights  economic and social understanding and international justice    Allow me  Mr  President  to ask you to convey to Mr  Hambro the tribute which my country wishes to extend to him  My delegation is extremely gratified to see the eminent representative of Norway presiding over our deliberations  Norway and Belgium already participate in many enterprises which I earlier called intermediate  Several Western and European ties of solidarity already bind us  and you know how happy we should be if the accession of Norway to the European Communities were to bring us even closer together  We congratulate the President for having brought to the highest office of the United Nations not only the virtues of his people  but also his own personal qualities of erudition  experience and authority    I would not wish to conclude without expressing again our great regard for the SecretaryGeneral of our Organization which  on behalf of my country  I have already had the honor to convey many times before from this rostrum  I wish to end my statement by once again assuring him of our highest esteem</td>\n",
       "      <td>no doubt each of we   before come up to this rostrum   wonder about the usefulness or futility of the speech   must we still speak when our voice be drown out by the mournful cry of so many victim of the world s disorder   our reply be yes   provide that   in listen to each other   we become more deeply convinced of our responsibility   for our part   we shall not extol the success of the United Nations   nor shall we allow ourselves to be discourage by its failure   a worldwide order of peace and justice can not be build in   year     be it not important in itself that our Organization   conceive in a very different moment of history   have withstand the change work by a single quarter century     in    no one doubt that the United Nations be necessary   on the contrary   people want it to be effective     it seem to we that one thing should encourage we all   it be the fact that in our country   in mine as in may other   the great principle   of the Charter be impress themselves more and more on conscience and especially on the conscience of the young   on the one hand we see that in most of our country many conviction be crumble   but on the other hand we find strong support than exist   year ago for the five choice make by our States in    indeed there be   and particularly among the young member of our population   an immediate response to the duty to organize collective security   the duty to disarm   the duty to ensure the equitable distribution of good among all people   respect for human right   and the settlement by arbitration or judicial process of legal dispute between States     all these aim   in our country and in many other   be become more and more sacred   imperative and urgent   the failure to observe these principle grow more shocking   and we be therefore urge to hasten the time when these principle and duty will be fulfil throughout the world     our response to this expectation be twofold   as we see it   the aim of the United Nations must be tackle on all front and   whenever possible   at several level not only by the central institution of the United Nations   but also by numerous regional action     we do not propose the establishment of new institution   but rather the adaptation and enhancement of those we already have     first of ail we wish and I be say first of all to strengthen the central institution of the United Nations   especially for the purpose of achieve two of their main purpose   security and development     whatever contribute towards make the Security Council more effective will have our support   my country be one of the sponsor of the draft resolution on international security   submit in the First Committee   which   inter alia   contain specific proposal for strengthen the authority of the Council   but I fully realize that these proposal will not achieve their purpose unless   beforehand   all States Members of our Organization reaffirm their political will to accept and implement the decision of the Council   in accordance with Article   of the Charter     furthermore   in specific   limited field   the Charter delegate to the Security Council real power   and this   as we see it   foreshadow a world executive in a way   but here   should not the General Assembly support the Council   to that end   we would be in favor of the General Assembly   within the context of Article   of the Charter   pronounce itself on the action of the Security Council   and hence of its closely study the annual report of the Council     we also wish to emphasize the importance of the meeting of the Security Council provide for in paragraph   of Article   of the Charter   which should be hold in the course of the work of the present session of the General Assembly   we have strongly support that action in previous year and now reaffirm our support     so much for the field of security   the same hold true with regard to development   we believe that the time be come when a certain power of decision will have to be vest in a world executive   it be no long sufficient for the Economic and Social Council or the General Assembly simply to set development target   some poverty will not be avoid unless   in specific case   some authority can enforce the necessary action in time   for the purpose of restore peace   do not the Charter confer such power on the Security Council   and sometimes the Council exercise they   the same need exist where hunger or underdevelopment be involve     accordingly   we believe that we be face with the problem of the exercise of the central authority of the United Nations and of strengthen this Organization     of course   the question of strengthen the authority of the United Nations also embrace the question of its universality   we welcome the fact that in a quarter of a century the sovereignty of so many formerly dependent territory have be recognize and their admission to membership in the United Nations guarantee it   such be the irreversible trend of decolonization   but the problem of universality present itself in another way   some people be represent here only in part or not at all   their absence be not conducive to peace or to peaceful relation between States   the time be not very far off   we believe   when we will be able to adopt an attitude more consistent with our principle   to achieve this   we must overcome the difficulty which still persist   especially with regard to China     in this particular case   my country have consistently urge   for five year   a solution that would enable the representative of the Government of the People s Republic of China a State which we recognize to occupy the seat which belong to China in the General Assembly and in the Security Council   this solution can not jeopardize the right of the representative of the Government of the Republic of Taiwan to continue to enjoy the protection of our Charter   and therefore to participate in the work of the United Nations   this be   we believe   the only possibility   until a peaceful settlement enable the dispute between these two chinese government to be compose   we also believe that the peaceful settlement of that dispute would thereby be facilitate     my country regret that a large number of States have inform we that they do not yet share our view   and we therefore do not wish to express it this year in the form of a draft resolution   but   on the other hand   so far   no one have convince we that any other attitude would be both more just and more consistent with the Charter   we shall continue our consultation with other government in seek the urgent solution which this important problem demand     we therefore attach the great importance to strengthen the central power of the United Nations and to its universality   but we hold it to be equally true that the purpose of the Charter can be successfully achieve   although in part   by mean of regional arrangement or organization   derive from the spontaneous action of country group together in a give area one action do not exclude the other   one action add to the other   the one aid the other     the idea be hardly revolutionary   it be suggest in many part of the Charter and it have already be put into effect in part but in our opinion   at this time in history   it deserve further reflection and a new impetus   the reason for this effort can   we think   be formulate in a few proposal     let we make use of this need   which have become evident and be relatively recent   which compel most States to have recourse to interState   organization in order to solve their economic   social   communication   supply   market   cultural   scientific and defense problem   which today separate nation can as a rule no long master by themselves     this necessity for interdependence which be relatively recent   I repeat have create the need today for new regional link of solidarity   these be natural   they be become more and more closely knit   each be form differently by a complex of historical and geographical factor   similarity of human environment   identical need and aspiration   relate political regime and philosophy   we believe th t we must make use of this natural movement     we must therefore imbue these new institution with the spirit of the Charter and   in each case   examine whether they can not constitute   in turn   an initial framework which encompass the purpose of the United Nations and try to achieve they first in a regional context   perhaps some obstacle which impede the power of decision of the Security Council might now be offset by this method     the regional organization   too   will   of course   remain incomplete and partly prevent from fulfil their objective     but if the purpose of the United Nations be thus pursue from the ground to the top and from top to bottom   if the complementarity of action be ensure and   if   of course   the world body still have the last word in the event of conflict policy   then we can hope for a great measure of overall success in pursue the purpose of the Charter     those be the reason which   in the light of experience   prompt we to cooperate eagerly I be speak of Belgium in the world organization and in their decentralize activity and also to participate actively in our region   Europe   in promote link of regional solidarity and interdependence     that will provide a well understanding of some of the attitude adopt by my country with regard to the present item and   first of all   I turn to the problem of security     the more than   States which share the territory of Europe can not forget that in the past   year they have unleash more war than the other continent   and that two of they have set the world on fire   as if this be not enough   a cold war have be divide they for the past quarter of a century   why have this new situation of conflict not lead to a third world war   because   we believe   very soon and very fortunately bond of solidarity and interdependence begin to create balanced situation   certain transnational grouping in Europe which   due to the cohesion they have acquire and that will be develop far   make possible today the effort gradually to reduce tension and then to foster understanding     we have therefore ask ourselves whether   some day   security arrangement of the kind provide for in Article   of the Charter might bring about and guarantee harmony in the territory of the whole of Europe through the establishment of rule and instrument of agreement   conciliation and arbitration of dispute   here it must be make quite clear that such arrangement can be no substitute for our exist economic solidarity and I be refer to the European Economic Communities or for the exist defense organization that be   the Atlantic Alliance but they should supplement they   similarly   if a security agreement for the whole of Europe be to be conclude some day   nor would it replace the task of the Security Council   but would remain subordinated to it through the link provide for in Article   of the Charter     finally   let we say it   a regional organization for the security of the whole of Europe can not be achieve so long as there be no political agreement on Berlin   no rule accept you all on the real equality of States   and so long as the principle of noninterference in the affair of other be not uphold in practice   event of only too recent memory show that transitional step be necessary to temper power politic by establish collective security   it be therefore necessary   in our opinion   to seek to have such regional security agreement for Europe   not as an immediately obtainable objective   but as an ultimate end to be reach only step by step     it be on the road to european regional security that the time be come when effort must be make to

hope that such negotiation will be possible as soon as the practical and wellknown condition for the ratification in Bonn of the GermanSoviet Treaty have be meet   and provide nothing else transpire

       "      <td>On behalf of the people and the Government of Yemen  I would like to congratulate the President most warmly on presiding over the General Assembly at its seventieth session  I wish him every success  I have come today from the brave and strategic city of Aden  which is experiencing great joy because it has been liberated from the Houthi militia and former President Saleh  Yet I am troubled to see the degree of damage that was left in the wake of those criminal militias  including the destruction of the city and the violence against its civilians  The tragedy is continuing in the cities of Taiz and Marib  It beggars the imagination to think that the number of martyrs just in Aden alone has reached    while the number of injured has reached    One can only imagine what the numbers are in Taiz  Marib  AlBaydhah  Abyan and other Yemeni cities  Three years ago  I addressed the Assembly and spoke of the different measures that we had undertaken in our country in order to ensure a successful political transition of power in a spirit of peace and in compliance with the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and its implementation mechanism and pursuant to relevant resolutions of the Security Council  see A  PV    I said then that Iran was hampering that process  It was training Houthi militias and providing them with weapons  delivered by boat or by other vessels  in order to impose the Iranian model in Yemen  Between that time three years ago and today  we have worked tirelessly on a peaceful political transition aimed at preparing the broad  yearlong national dialogue  bringing together all the political forces of Yemen and setting an honourable precedent       A  PV  in our country and the region  That was followed by a transparent process for drafting a secular  democratic modern constitution  The Assembly followed the political time lines and dates as they arose and provided direct support  SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon also provided direct support and visited our country  All elements of Yemeni society  including the Houthis  were part of the process  In addition  there have been visits by the Special Envoy of the SecretaryGeneral and the Security Council  as well as the adoption of relevant Security Council resolutions and presidential statements  Despite all that  as the political transition process was drawing to a close and just when the constitution was supposed to be submitted to a popular referendum  the Houthis and Saleh staged a military and political coup d  tat  occupying the capital  Sana a  and wreaking havoc on hospitals  mosques  Quranic schools  homes and residences  Every form of weaponry was used  including arms from the Yemeni army  The tragedies in Aden  Taiz and Ad Dali could be characterized as genocide  Indeed  it was a desperate attempt to impose the Iranian model through the use of force  Political leaders and thousands of citizens either disappeared or were killed  The media were also affected  Thousands of children were forcibly conscripted  antipersonnel mines were planted and schools  public buildings and homes were converted into weapons storage facilities and barracks  Houthi militia threatened to spread to neighbouring countries  thereby endangering regional and international peace and security  We attempted to have a dialogue with Saleh and the Houthis  giving them immunity and every opportunity and including them in national dialogue  but they retained their weapons and refused to create a political party in accordance with established law  That was all accepted despite the events that took place in   Saleh s fight has never been a peaceful one  as was  for example  the peaceful southern movement  in Sa dah province  which saw its citizens expelled  The Houthis seized military areas and took control by force  Despite our positive approach to that armed movement and various understandings with the Houthi movement  agreements were repeatedly cast aside and a coup d  tat was carried out against the State  and people were maltreated and severely punished  The actions of the Houthi militias  as well as those of Saleh  led us to appeal to neighbouring countries in the Gulf under Article  of the Charter of the United Nations  We appealed for assistance in tackling the Houthi militias that were undermining and threatening national legitimacy  The response was courageous  Our brother His Majesty Salman Bin Abdulaziz AlSaud  of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  acted with utter determination  On behalf of the Yemeni people  I would like to convey our sincere thanks to His Majesty King Salman and to all members of the coalition who are pursuing efforts to assist the Yemeni people  We are joined together in blood in this battle for our country and for the legitimacy of the State in order to prevent the country from falling into the hands of Iran  which would like to see the destruction of the country and to control the Bab alMandab strait  The Yemeni people have opposed attempts by the Houthis in Aden  Abyan  AlBaydhah  Taiz  Hodeidah and other cities of Yemen  The people have upheld the law  I would like to commend the efforts of the brave national resistance and the national armed forces  who are indeed our partners in struggle and in victory  construction and development  The Assembly is aware of the human tragedy that has befallen our people as a result of the blockade imposed by the militias  which continue their coup d  tat  The Assembly is also aware of the deterioration and destruction of public services in liberated provinces  Greater international effort is needed to alleviate the human suffering and to ensure that the Yemeni crisis is not forgotten  While the United Nations has announced an appeal for humanitarian assistance for Yemen  annual contributions continue to fall short and cover only a meagre portion of the actual need  I therefore take this opportunity to appeal once again to donor countries to ensure that they provide promised assistance  The Government of the Republic of Yemen would like to see the arrival of emergency humanitarian assistance to provide for all provinces without exception  An oversight mechanism for humanitarian convoys  as proposed by the United Nations  would allow for the return of economic prosperity and would facilitate the arrival of humanitarian assistance through all Yemeni ports  Furthermore  the Government has been moved to Aden  I believe that that will lead to better living conditions for our citizens  It will also reestablish basic services  which have been destroyed by the militias of the Houthis and Saleh  Without a doubt  and quite clearly  that remains the best way for me to remain side by side with my heroic and steadfast people  That has been our position since    A  PV     the very beginning of the conflict  We have cooperated with all genuine efforts on the part of the international community and  in particular  with those of Secretary General Ban Kimoon and Mr  Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed  the Special Envoy of the SecretaryGeneral  to end the coup d  tat  pursuant to Security Council resolution      Since that resolution  the political process has been resumed  guided by the results of the national dialogue and facilitated by the Gulf Cooperation Council  Allow me to reiterate that all efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the political crisis should be welcomed and supported  Once again  I would like to convey to the rebels  the HouthiSaleh militias  that they must lay down their weapons  act in line with reason and implement resolution     in earnest  I have come here to support peace and accord  I am talking not about a divisive peace but rather of a permanent peace that will be a source of law and order  cohesion and justice  Allow me to advocate for the literal implementation of the most recent Security Council resolution  namely  resolution      which bears the credibility of the Council itself  I hope that the efforts of the United Nations will be crowned with success  That will ensure that we act in accordance with the aspirations of our people  who have been exceedingly patient and sincere  Terrorism represents a real threat to States  To the extent of our ability  we have tried to combat terrorism  against which we have conducted a determined campaign  in partnership with friendly countries  The coup d  tat and the extremism that ensued created a breeding ground for terrorism  I would like to reiterate  however  our confidence in and support for the Government  which is leading the fight against terrorism with international aid  Given the geographical and strategic location of Yemen  the stability of our country buttresses the stability of the region and the world  The seventieth session of the General Assembly coincides with the glorious September and October revolutions of my country  I would like to express my thanks and gratitude to all the Yemeni people  who are a proud and patient people  I would like to restate my commitment to achieving the goals of those two glorious revolutions  We will not allow minority groups  Houthis or others  to repeat the Iranian experience in Yemen  At this time   years since the birth of the United Nations  an Organization that has succeeded in lessening conflicts and wars through its very principles  we reiterate our commitment to working on behalf of future generations  That represents a commitment to those generations  as well as a commitment to making the world more prosperous  safer and free through unity and true determination to achieve the noble ambitions  on which our Organization was established  The Republic of Yemen condemns in the strongest terms the systematic Israeli attacks against the AlAqsa Mosque  Once again  we express our permanent support for the Palestinian people  who are determined to protect the Mosque  A question necessarily arises regarding those recent events  A Government that was created by resolutions of the Security Council refuses to abide by those same resolutions  That is truly surprising  I would like to thank SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon for his important efforts to achieve the noble ambition of our Organization to ensure international peace and security  I would also like to thank him for his great and commendable efforts to promote the political transition in Yemen  reverse the coup d  tat and restore State authority  We wish every success to the General Assembly at its seventieth session</td>\n",

       "      <td>Seventy years have passed since the establishment of the United Nations  People live differently now  many changes have taken place and many reforms have been effected  It is time that we reform the United Nations as well  I call on the President to speed up this process during his mandate  Perhaps no other session in the history of the General Assembly has come at a more opportune time  Last year saw many new developments  Negotiations  which were unimaginable before  were started to end the embargo on Cuba  An agreement was reached to lift sanctions on Iran  We recognize those who took part in making these historic decisions and encourage them to see these changes through to completion  This is very much in line with the policy my country has pursued for a number of decades  The world of today does not resemble the world of yesterday  and none of us can remain indifferent to this fact  Ours used to be a bipolar world  divided into blocs  We did not thrive because the poles were violently    A  PV     opposed to one another and had access to the most dangerous weapons the world possessed at the time  But we are also not doing well in a world with one Power that carries out diplomacy by issuing threats  oblivious to the concerns of all others  including those of the United Nations  Peoples and States attend to their own interests and are thereby exposed and open to extremist religious fanatics  giving rise to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and other extremist movements  These terrorist groups now threaten millions of people and have created a negative image of Islam  the religion on whose behalf they profess to act  The two key elements of law and ethics were once key in international relations and politics  United States President Woodrow Wilson was a staunch advocate  while the great Serbian poet Njego  expressed it in verses of The Mountain Wreath in the following way  Along his path who maketh Might his right Rise stenches of inhuman cruelty     As Wolf doth on the Sheep impose his might  So tyrant lords it over feebler fellow  But foot to place upon the Tyrant s neck  To bring him to the consciousness of Right   This of all human duties is most sacred Today  however  legal and ethical factors are essentially being eclipsed in international politics  Not infrequently  unlawful and exceedingly immoral actions are being taken  purportedly for ethical and legal reasons  This happens most often when a clear legal norm that brooks no exception   such as the need for the Security Council to take a decision  for instance   stands in the way of a major Power achieving its geopolitical goals  International law  therefore  and the moral tenets underpinning a legal norm and its implementation  are deeply in crisis today  There is ample evidence of this  including the most recent largescale crisis  Some call it a migrant crisis  others refer to it as another wave of people migrating for various reasons  What worries us  though  is that those who think that efforts should be intensified in the hope of restoring peace quickly and easily and promoting economic progress for all   developing countries  in particular   are few and far between  We ought to look each other in the eye and assess the past year with an open mind  We ought to announce what has been achieved in our countries  Some of us ought to ask themselves if their actions helped humankind or threatened the future of our children  Can we still begin our speeches with  We  the peoples of the United Nations   Are we any closer to peace and prosperity or are we rushing  with blindfolds on  towards another   which saw the start of a major world tragedy that lasted six years and whose consequences we shall never be able to erase  Some of the mighty and powerful seem to believe that the world economic crisis did not do enough to terrify our children and their parents  They continue to use highly sophisticated weapons to drive people from their homes and countries and thrust them  in fear for their lives  into the turmoil of migration  journeying thousands of kilometres in a world without food  water or electricity  The responsibility for these developments lies not with those who struggle to fight poverty and create conditions in their countries conducive to a dignified human life  or with Serbia  which has opened soup kitchens in order to give many their only daily meal  It lies with those who have much  whether Godgiven or gained by exploiting others  It lies with those who spend more on arms than all the world s poor countries together spend on food  It lies with all of us  because we cannot contemplate sustainable development without accepting our shared responsibility to tackle one of the world s major challenges   eradicating or at least alleviating poverty  I often wonder how parents can look their children in the eye as they tell them that school and learning are important for their future and a normal life  and try to convince them that they will have food on their plates once they finish school and acquire learning  We do not learn when we live in fear  have nothing to eat or are threatened by disease  when our parents are unemployed or we face the threat of a terrible war  Those here representing the rich and powerful should think about that as they put their children to bed in a warm room at night and make important decisions during the day  Are profits and political or military superiority really worth so much that we no longer feel the sufferings of others but rather let baser instincts take over  Peace and prosperity cannot be a privilege for the people of certain countries alone  every man and woman on planet Earth has a right to them  That       A  PV  is why we hold out a helping hand in our quest to achieve the Goals of the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  resolution    through shared actions aimed at creating a better future for humankind  based on principles that can ensure progress and prosperity for all  Sustainable development is clearly a concept accepted by most of the world  It postulates a global economy linking every region of the world on a basis of trust  ethics  equality and support  as well as a comprehensive approach to managing development by analysing and assessing the efforts of Governments and businesses  All management  however  requires that certain rules be established  and the question therefore is  Who will establish the rules and where  Can individuals  or groups of individuals  foresee all possible future events and developments  and is it possible to control those events and developments at all  Are we simply establishing a new global power centre  oblivious to the individual specifics of States or groups of States  an organization that has only one solution to all problems  What can we do about the fact that some of the Goals do not correspond to some countries  specific situations  We must understand that we cannot control everyone s lives even if we think it may be risky to leave things up to their free will  Major changes in the way we live demand that we allow time to adjust to ensure that basic values do not collapse  Today  the world is extraordinarily interconnected in miraculous  virtual ways  information is exchanged and people and goods move at unprecedented speed  But the people themselves have never been so alienated  In huge cities  amid millions  people die alone  Individuals  States and international organizations become alienated  There are many reasons for this  Increasingly  relations among States are based on the more powerful  affluent and developed imposing their will on others  We hope that our new era will usher in a new beginning  a new way of thinking  whose essence will be  as it should  in the best interests of people and their immediate and larger communities  We all understand that this is not easy to achieve  for modern communications can be used to impose a way of thinking aimed at implementing ideas that are not in the interests of the majority  Modern man s urge to conform and daily struggle to meet ever greater demands  along with the spectre of unemployment and hardships in later life  undermine his resolve to resist increasingly evident violations of basic human rights  The world today is tragically divided between a few enormously rich individuals and a majority who live outside the boundaries of human dignity  The twentyfirst century threatens to be an age in which some countries accumulate and concentrate enormous individual wealth and the rest are consigned to poverty and uncertainty  Among those wealthy individuals is also an entirely new generation of privileged directors who  unjustifiably and immorally  are paid far more than their employees  It seems  however  that the numbers of those willing to protest this phenomenon has been growing to a point where their demands may have to be acceded to  I urge everyone to work together to help to achieve an equitable distribution of the world s assets and resources  We continue to talk noncommittally about another major challenge  that of climate change  as if its consequences were not patently evident everywhere  and as if we did not see that they are exacerbating the friction caused by the already high level of inequality in the world  In a wakeup call of sorts  the consequences of our past and current actions now have the greatest effect on the weakest of us  the countries that are still undeveloped industrially and struggling to provide their citizens with a better life  Most developing countries account for just a fraction of global warming  They must be given the opportunity to grow their economies under the same conditions that have already enabled other countries to prosper  even though their greenhouse gas emissions may be higher than the rich would like  We must develop technologies that can enable developing countries to develop while being as environmentally responsible as possible  rather than using concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global warming as pretexts to allow their industry to stagnate  There are moral reasons  too  for ensuring that countries develop  Politicians should be tasked with providing full support to scientific activities  on the one hand  and harmonizing and coordinating responses to climate change and extreme weather situations  on the other  Adapting and preparing national and social responses to potential scenarios  including worstcase scenarios  should be our most basic and important goal  Serbia s Government and scientific institutions  in full compliance with the relevant international documents  first and foremost among them the United    A  PV     Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC  and the Kyoto Protocol  will continue to contribute to the activities of the United Nations and other organizations  primarily through European and regional initiatives on climate monitoring and reducing the negative effects of climate change  Serbia welcomes the forthcoming twentyfirst session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC to be held in Paris later this year  We intend to support and make a full contribution to consideration of this important issue  We will continue to work together with others as a team and an active participant  in hopes that scientists will come up with clear answers and irrevocable proof as soon as possible  while politicians support them and implement speedy  effective solutions  We can hope for a better future only if we overcome problems such as hunger  wars and diseases  Serbia has therefore actively participated in peacekeeping operations all over the world and has made every effort to train and equip growing numbers of its officers and soldiers to take part in such important assignments  In that regard  this year Serbia s chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been universally commended  including by those currently in conflict situations  I should also add that Serbia has been a candidate country of the European Union for more than three years now and has continued to take decisive steps to harmonize its systems and practices with European Union standards  At the same time  Serbia has also continued to maintain its cooperation and friendship with Russia and China  A State is made up of its territory  its people  its languages and its cultural heritage  Serbia is the only country in Europe that in addition to seeing part of its territory seized  its people expelled and their murders and the socalled harvesting of their organs going unpunished  has now had to deal with attacks on its cultural heritage under the protection of UNESCO  Here I recall that in March   in the face of only sporadic opposition from the Kosovo Force  KFOR   Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija destroyed numerous Christian Orthodox churches  other church buildings  convents  bell towers and monastery libraries and archives  usually by setting fires or explosive devices  That was only the brutal and effective perpetuation of the damage and destruction of over  Orthodox sanctuaries perpetrated since the arrival of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the KFOR in June   In that period  the Albanian terrorists systematically destroyed the spiritual and cultural heritage of the Serbian people in Kosovo and Metohija  Their centurieslong existence there is evinced in the many monasteries and churches whose foundations were laid before the ninth century and represent Serbian deeds etched in stone  the testimony of the Serbian presence in Kosovo and Metohija  At the thirtyfirst session of its General Conference  UNESCO confirmed that a crime against a cultural heritage was committed in Kosovo and Metohija  In the small territory of Kosovo and Metohija  UNESCO has registered  highly valuable cultural monuments of the Serbian people  as clearly defined by UNESCO standards  As many as  monuments from the Middle Ages have been identified as a part of European and world heritage in which humankind can take pride and honour  Specifically  they served our pride and honour  These invaluable and unique works of art and architecture have survived five centuries of Ottoman rule  the Balkan Wars and the First and Second World Wars  Yet  there they were  in   being savagely desecrated and destroyed  buried and ploughed over  as though that undertaking was a part of preparations  designed with meticulous precision  to coincide with the unilateral declaration of independence of the Republic of Kosovo  an event that ensued four years after the barbaric destruction of the patrimony of Serbia s Christian culture and civilization  Not only Serbian  but also European culture and the world s collective memory are preserved in Kosovo and Metohija  representing an important human civilizational achievement on planet Earth  It is therefore important that Serbia  as a member of UNESCO  continues to be the keeper of this cultural treasure  which belongs both to Serbia and to the world  In an attempt to falsify history   unfortunately with the support of a certain number of countries   Albania has submitted  on behalf of the Pristina Administration  a request to UNESCO that the Serbian heritage be declared Kosovar   that is  Albanian  Those who strategically destroyed monasteries with the aim of marginalizing the importance of Kosovo and Metohija for the Serbs and of establishing a new ethnic and cultural identity for Kosovo and Metohija on the ashes of the history of others  would be rewarded in that way  How is it possible that arsonists and destroyers  with goals that clearly go beyond all the ethical norms and established rules on which UNESCO was founded        A  PV  are now trying to project themselves as guardians and protectors  Should that request be accepted nonetheless  a dangerous precedent would be set and the door would be opened for the legitimization of violence against the national  cultural and religious identity of any people anywhere  By defending the right of Serbia to preserve and proudly present its identity and cultural heritage  as it has done for the past  centuries  by preventing the unscrupulous dispossession of one s heritage and its attribution to somebody else  we are defending the underlying principles of international law and human justice  as well as those on which UNESCO was founded  I therefore call on all Heads of State not to allow the Serbian people to have its soul excised  its essence usurped and its monasteries in Kosovo and Metohija  its spiritual backbone  declared the cultural heritage of the Albanian people there  In short  that is neither the truth nor a historical and scientific fact  It is not justice  Peoples do not acquire history and civilization by snatching centuries of the existence of others or by bribing  with Judas  silver  those to whom the history of others means nothing and who would stand by indifferently if the spiritual and cultural roots of a people   in this case of we Serbs   were removed from the areas from which they had been expelled  The United Nations must preserve its credibility and stand up to the injustice and evil that Serbia would suffer if the Organization acquiesced to that undertaking  I am certain that those gathered here  as responsible and honourable persons of State  will stand up against the injustice and wrong that would be inflicted upon Serbia and could have a domino effect on other nations and States  Serbia is talking to the representatives of the Administration in Pristina  It will fulfil all its obligations under Security Council resolution     and all its obligations under the agreements reached in Brussels  but it will never  ever recognize the independence of part of its territory  the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija  to which its very existence is connected  The problem of the mass migration from the Middle East is the greatest challenge of our times  We cannot analyse the causes and or identify those directly and indirectly responsible for the migrant crisis here and now  It is an issue of paramount importance and should be addressed at an international forum that would bring together prominent leaders and eminent scholars and scientists  That is the best way to assess the situation objectively  provide an answer and propose a solution to that complex problem  The humanitarian disaster facing the world is only a consequence of the crisis that has shaken Syria for the past four years  all along without an adequate response from the international community  Without access to common funding  the situation of Serbia is perhaps more difficult than that of the other countries of the old continent  Despite its difficult economic situation  Serbia is making every effort to provide decent conditions and accommodation for refugees  However  if the international community  and the European Union above all  fails to make concrete efforts to solve the problem  a humanitarian catastrophe of an even larger scale would threaten SouthEast Europe  The consequences are impossible to foresee  but they would surely affect not only Europe  but the whole world as well  As regards the number of asylum seekers in the Republic of Serbia    persons arrived in Serbia between  January and  September  and only  have submitted asylum requests  I would like to draw attention to the alarming practice of some Governments that have erected wire and razor fences to ghettoize the asylumseekers fleeing war and destitution  Such an attitude runs counter to the  Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the proclaimed solidarity of the States members of the European Union with migrants  It also aggravates the situation in countries that respect international law and treat the individuals struck by calamity humanely  The Governments of certain States Members of the United Nations behave as if they had never abandoned the ideology that prevailed before the end of the Second World War  thereby destroying the fragile stability in the Balkans that was achieved through hard work and dedication  to which Serbia contributed the most  My country has had to cope with a deep economic crisis since   Refugees  therefore  cannot expect to secure much more than their personal safety in Serbia  We will provide it to them irrespective of the fact that certain countries also intervene against people living in Serbian territory  Our care for humankind and our empathy for those in need  as well as our resolve to give those people what we may not need as urgently as they do at the moment  will not diminish  Our borders are open to receive them and to let them through  We need no law for that because that is the way we are  Serbia is    A  PV     not a member of the European Union  but it consistently implements the proclaimed principle of solidarity  a fundamental value and the supposedly unconditional mainstay of the Union itself  I do not understand this selfishness  and sometimes even the hatred towards those who have nothing that some individuals have come to nurture  If the rapid pace with which the leaders of some countries are losing their cool and composure are any clue  the situation can only deteriorate  We therefore need a comprehensive plan that would have to be implemented within the shortest possible time  Without such a plan  migrants will be left altogether at the mercy of human smugglers  Passivity and the increasingly inhumane treatment of migrants open a market for smugglers  The sequence of catastrophes that would ensue in such a case  from the Mediterranean to the British Isles  would be tragic  and the tragedy in which over  people died would be remembered as just one sad link in that sorry chain  Even though it was not directly involved in the conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia in the s  started and stagemanaged in a similar way to the conflict in Syria  Serbia was labelled guilty  A resolution was even recently submitted to the Security Council to stigmatize the Serbs as an example of a genocidal people  although such a characterization of any people in the world is unjustifiable  The attempt failed  as members of the Security Council were aware of the true intentions and desires of the initiators  as well as the possible catastrophic consequences  What kind of genocidal criminals are we  Is it the image imparted by the footage of migrants in Serbia  undaunted and unworried about the reaction of our people and authorities  unlike elsewhere in the region  or is it the image of a hospitable people with a kind heart  Have Serbian citizens changed  They have not  The people of Serbia of all ethnicities have  now and in the past  been humane and hospitable  as well as good neighbours  In addition to refugees from Syria  Afghanistan  Pakistan and Iraq  Serbia hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons from the territory of the former Yugoslavia  They are preponderantly Serbs  but include also Bosniaks  Croats  Roma and others  Some of these people have gone to third countries  while others continue to live in Serbia  We are still faced with the consequences of these migration as they have altered the demographic  social and other structures of our country and society  Then and now  my country has not had much to offer to these destitute people who left their homes  It has shared the little it had  Serbia expects the United Nations Member States to act responsibly and humanely  We should all bear in mind that this situation will have global consequences  Civilization is at a crossroads  Europe is going through serious travails and tribulations  Now is the time for it to show if it still is the standardbearer in the implementation of human rights and the respect of international law or if it continues to turn a blind eye to the apparent double standards and allows the attainment of civilization to be valid only for some countries and some peoples  Equality is applicable not only to relations among individuals  but also to relations among States  Our fathers shed blood on many battlefields for the equality of all peoples  They fought for our freedom to speak our mind and for our opinion to be strong enough to change things  Freedom and equality are the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations  of numerous international documents and of national constitutions  We must not allow them to become dead letters  By taking up these topics and drawing members  attention to them  I hope to motivate us to show genuine empathy and solidarity  to take responsibility for the future and to build  together and indefatigably  true humanism in the Organization that gathered us together here today  I would like us to meet in this place with different messages next year and  if not with our problems solved  then at least with steps made towards solving the problems that burden us today  I would like us to be better every coming year  I would like the States of the world to feel that the ideas of liberty and equality and of a humane and just society are not just empty rhetoric  but instead genuinely resolve to implement them throughout our planet</td>\n",
       "      <td>seventy year have pass since the establishment of the United Nations   People live differently now   many change have take place and many reform have be effect   it be time that we reform the United Nations as well   I call on the President to speed up this process during his mandate   perhaps no other session in the history of the General Assembly have come at a more opportune time   last year see many new development   Negotiations   which be unimaginable before   be start to end the embargo on Cuba   an agreement be reach to lift sanction on Iran   we recognize those who take part in make these historic decision and encourage they to see these change through to completion   this be very much in line with the policy my country have pursue for a number of decade   the world of today do not resemble the world of yesterday   and none of we can remain indifferent to this fact   our use to be a bipolar world   divide into blocs   we do not thrive because the pole be violently     a   pv      oppose to one another and have access to the most dangerous weapon the world possess at the time   but we be also not do well in a world with one power that carry out

  however   legal and ethical factor be essentially be eclipse in international politic   not infrequently   unlawful and exceedingly immoral action be be take   purportedly for ethical and legal reason   this happen most often when a clear legal norm that brook no exception    such as the need for the Security Council to take a decision   for instance    stand in the way of a major power achieve its geopolitical goal   International law   therefore   and the moral tenet underpin a legal norm and its implementation   be deeply in crisis today   there be ample evidence of this   include the most recent largescale crisis   some call it a migrant crisis   other refer to it as another wave of people migrate for various reason   what worry we   though   be that those who think that effort should be intensify in the hope of restore peace quickly and easily and promote economic progress for all    develop country   in particular    be few and far between   we ought to look each other in the eye and assess the past year with an open mind   we ought to announce what have be achieve in our country   some of we ought to ask themselves if their action help humankind or threaten the future of our child   can we still begin our speech with   we   the people of the United Nations    be we any close to peace and prosperity or be we rush   with blindfold on   towards another    which see the start of a major world tragedy that last six year and whose consequence we shall never be able to erase   some of the mighty and powerful seem to believe that the world economic crisis do not do enough to terrify our child and their parent   they continue to use highly sophisticated weapon to drive people from their home and country and thrust they   in fear for their life   into the turmoil of migration   journey thousand of kilometre in a world without food   water or electricity   the responsibility for these development lie not with those who struggle to fight poverty and create condition in their country conducive to a dignified human life   or with Serbia   which have open soup kitchen in order to give many their only daily meal   it lie with those who have much   whether Godgiven or gain by exploit other   it lie with those who spend more on arm than all the world s poor country together spend on food   it lie with all of we   because we can not contemplate sustainable development without accept our share responsibility to tackle one of the world s major challenge    eradicating or at least alleviate poverty   I often wonder how parent can look their child in the eye as they tell they that school and learning be important for their future and a normal life   and try to convince they that they will have food on their plate once they finish school and acquire learn   we do not learn when we live in fear   have nothing to eat or be threaten by disease   when our parent be unemployed or we face the threat of a terrible war   those here represent the rich and powerful should think about that as they put their child to bed in a warm room at night and make important decision during the day   be profit and political or military superiority really worth so much that we no long feel the suffering of other but rather let baser instinct take over   peace and prosperity can not be a privilege for the people of certain country alone   every man and woman on planet Earth have a right to they   that        a   PV   be why we hold out a help hand in our quest to achieve the goal of the   Agenda for Sustainable Development   resolution     through

effort of government and business   all management   however   require that certain rule be establish   and the question therefore be   who will establish the rule and where   can individual   or group of individual   foresee all possible future event and development   and be it possible to control those event and development at all   be we simply establish a new global power centre   oblivious to the individual specific of state or group of States   an organization that have only one solution to all problem   what can we do about the fact that some of the goal do not correspond to some country   specific situation   we must understand that we can not control everyone s life even if we think it may be risky to leave thing up to their free will   major change in the way we live demand that we allow time to adjust to ensure that basic value do not collapse   today   the world be extraordinarily interconnect in miraculous   virtual way   information be exchange and people and good move at unprecedented speed   but the people themselves have never be so alienate   in huge city   amid million   people die alone   individual   States and international organization become alienated   there be many reason for this   increasingly   relation among States be base on the more powerful   affluent and develop impose their will on other   we hope that our new era will usher in a new beginning   a new way of thinking   whose essence will be   as it should   in the good interest of people and their immediate and large community   we all understand that this be not easy to achieve   for modern communication can be use to impose a way of thinking aim at implement idea that be not in the interest of the majority   modern man s urge to conform and daily struggle to meet ever great demand   along with the spectre of unemployment and hardship in later life   undermine his resolve to resist increasingly evident violation of basic human right   the world today be tragically divide between a few enormously rich individual and a majority who live outside the boundary of human dignity   the twentyfirst century threaten to be an age in which some country accumulate and concentrate enormous individual wealth and the rest be consign to poverty and uncertainty   among those wealthy individual be also an entirely new generation of privileged director who   unjustifiably and immorally   be pay far more than their employee   it seem   however   that the number of those willing to protest this phenomenon have be grow to a point where their demand may have to be accede to   I urge everyone to work together to help to achieve an equitable distribution of the world s asset and resource   we continue to talk noncommittally about another major challenge   that of climate change   as if its consequence be not patently evident everywhere   and as if we do not see that they be exacerbate the friction cause by the already high level of inequality in the world   in a wakeup call of sort   the consequence of our past and current action now have the great effect on the weak of we   the country that be still undeveloped industrially and struggle to provide their citizen with a well life   most develop country account for just a fraction of global warming   they must be give the opportunity to grow their economy under the same condition that have already enable other country to prosper   even though their greenhouse gas emission may be high than the rich would like   we must develop technology that can enable develop country to develop while be as environmentally responsible as possible   rather than use concern about greenhouse gas emission and global warming as pretext to allow their industry to stagnate   there be moral reason   too   for ensure that country develop   Politicians should be task with provide full support to scientific activity   on the one hand   and harmonize and coordinate response to climate change and extreme weather situation   on the other   adapt and prepare national and social response to potential scenario   include worstcase scenario   should be our most basic and important goal   Serbia s Government and scientific institution   in full compliance with the relevant international document   first and foremost among they the United     A   pv      Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change   UNFCCC   and the Kyoto Protocol   will continue to contribute to the activity of the United Nations and other organization   primarily through european and regional initiative on climate monitoring and reduce the negative effect of climate change   Serbia welcome the forthcoming twentyfirst session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC to be hold in Paris later this year   we intend to support and make a full contribution to consideration of this important issue   we will continue to work together with other as a team and an active participant   in hope that scientist will come up with clear answer and irrevocable proof as soon as possible   while politician support they and implement speedy   effective solution   we can hope for a well future only if we overcome problem such as hunger   war and disease   Serbia have therefore actively participate in peacekeeping operation all over the world and have make every effort to train and equip grow number of its officer and soldier to take part in such important assignment   in that regard   this year Serbia s chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have be universally commend   include by those currently in conflict situation   I should also add that Serbia have be a candidate country of the European Union for more than three year now and have continue to take decisive step to harmonize its system and practice with European Union standard   at the same time   Serbia have also continue to maintain its cooperation and friendship with Russia and China   a State be make up of its territory   its people   its language and its cultural heritage   Serbia be the only country in Europe that in addition to see part of its territory seize   its people expel and their murder and the socalled harvesting of their organ go unpunished   have now have to deal with attack on its cultural heritage under the protection of UNESCO   here I recall that in March    in the face of only sporadic opposition from the Kosovo Force   KFOR    Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija destroy numerous Christian Orthodox church   other church building   convent   bell tower and monastery library and archive   usually by set fire or explosive device   that be only the brutal and effective perpetuation of the damage and destruction of over   Orthodox sanctuary perpetrate since the arrival of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the KFOR in June    in that period   the albanian terrorist systematically destroy the spiritual and cultural heritage of the serbian people in Kosovo and Metohija   their centurieslong existence there be evince in the many monastery and church whose foundation be lay before the ninth century and represent serbian deed etch in stone   the testimony of the serbian presence in Kosovo and Metohija   at the thirtyfirst session of its General Conference   UNESCO confirm that a crime against a cultural heritage be commit in Kosovo and Metohija   in the small territory of Kosovo and Metohija   UNESCO have register   highly valuable cultural monument of the serbian people   as clearly define by UNESCO standard   as many as   monument from the Middle Ages have be identify as a part of european and world heritage in which humankind can take pride and honour   specifically   they serve our pride and honour   these invaluable and unique work of art and architecture have survive five century of Ottoman rule   the Balkan Wars and the first and second World Wars   yet   there they be   in    be savagely desecrate and destroy   bury and plough over   as though that undertaking be a part of preparation   design with meticulous precision   to coincide with the unilateral declaration of independence of the Republic of Kosovo   an event that ensue four year after the barbaric destruction of the patrimony of Serbia s christian culture and civilization   not only serbian   but also european culture and the world s collective memory be preserve in Kosovo and Metohija   represent an important human civilizational achievement on planet Earth   it be therefore important that Serbia   as a member of UNESCO   continue to be the keeper of this cultural treasure   which belong both to Serbia and to the world   in an attempt to falsify history    unfortunately with the support of a certain number of country    Albania have submit   on behalf of the Pristina Administration   a request to UNESCO that the serbian heritage be declare Kosovar    that be   albanian   those who strategically destroy monastery with the aim of marginalize the importance of Kosovo and Metohija for the Serbs and of establish a new ethnic and cultural identity for Kosovo and Metohija on the ashe of the history of other   would be reward in that way   how be it possible that arsonist and destroyer   with goal that clearly go you all the ethical norm and establish rule on which UNESCO be found         A   PV   be now try to project themselves as guardian and protector   should that request be accept nonetheless   a dangerous precedent would be set and the door would be open for the legitimization of violence against the national   cultural and religious identity of any people anywhere   by defend the right of Serbia to preserve and proudly present its identity and cultural heritage   as it have do for the past   century   by prevent the unscrupulous dispossession of one s heritage and its attribution to somebody else   we be defend the underlie principle of international law and human justice   as well as those on which UNESCO be found   I therefore call on all head of State not to allow the serbian people to have its soul excise   its essence usurped and its monastery in Kosovo and Metohija   its spiritual backbone   declare the cultural heritage of the albanian people there   in short   that be neither the truth nor a historical and scientific fact   it be not justice   Peoples do not acquire history and civilization by snatch century of the existence of other or by bribe   with Judas   silver   those to whom the history of other mean nothing and who would stand by indifferently if the spiritual and cultural root of a people    in this case of we Serbs    be remove from the area from which they have be expel   the United Nations must preserve its credibility and stand up to the injustice and evil

       "      <td>I should like to congratulate the President and his country  Denmark  on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session  He has South Africa s full support for his presidency  The theme that he has chosen   The United Nations at   the road ahead for peace  security and human rights   is timely and relevant to the current global challenges facing the world today  Furthermore  allow me to convey our gratitude to the President of the Assembly at its sixtyninth session  Mr  Sam Kutesa of the Republic of Uganda  for the outstanding manner in which he represented Africa at the helm of the General Assembly during that session  The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations marks a significant moment in the history of global governance  The Charter embodies  through its principles and objectives  the aspirations of oppressed people worldwide  We would also like to acknowledge the role of the United Nations General Assembly over the past  years  Rooted in the principle of sovereign equality  the Assembly is the most representative international institution and organ of the United Nations  The General Assembly has over the years remained central to the provision of support to the disadvantaged  marginalized  occupied  colonized and oppressed peoples of the world  This body elevated the South African struggle for liberation internationally when it declared apartheid a crime against humanity  Mr  Oliver Tambo  the former President of our liberation movement  the African National Congress  addressed the General Assembly from this very podium on  October   see A  PV   and spoke from other United Nations platforms as well on other occasions  Many other eminent South Africans were provided an opportunity in various United Nations forums to state our case for freedom  the United Nations providing a voice to the voiceless  A free South Africa has also been honoured by the declaration of  July as International Mandela Day  honouring our founding President and world icon  President Nelson Mandela  At this celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations I wish to extend  on behalf of the people of South Africa  our sincere gratitude to the world for its contribution to our freedom from the shackles of apartheid and institutionalized racism  The General Assembly continues to provide a voice for the voiceless and the oppressed  In an historic and landmark development the General Assembly approved a resolution to allow the Palestinian flag to fly in front of United Nations Headquarters  resolution     The resolution was passed by an overwhelming margin  supported by many nations from both the developed North and the developing South  There can be no peace  security and development in the Middle East without a resolution of the Palestinian question  A solution is urgent  Otherwise  if we delay  in the next decade we may no longer have a piece of land to justify the two State solution  The historic seventieth anniversary of the United Nations presents an opportunity to reflect on the structure and workings of the Organization  Significantly  this year marks the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the World Summit Outcome  resolution    in   which discussed reform of the United Nations  A number of significant decisions on reform have been successfully implemented since that Summit  They include the following  the replacement of the Human Rights Commission with a more effective Human Rights Council  the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission as a subsidiary body of both the General Assembly and the Security Council  the reform and streamlining of the United Nations management system  the mainstreaming of gender equality through the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  UNWomen  and the membershipdriven responsibility to protect and to assist populations facing genocide  crimes against humanity  war crimes and ethnic cleansing  We welcome that notable progress  However  almost no progress has been made on the commitment also made by Heads of State and Government in  to the early reform of the Security Council  It is unacceptable and unjustifiable that more than  billion people in the African continent are still excluded from permanent membership in the key decisionmaking structure of the United Nations  the Security Council  A continent with a smaller population than Africa is represented by three countries on the Security Council as permanent members  That is unfair  The United Nations cannot pretend that the world has not changed since   We are no longer colonies  We are free  independent sovereign States  We welcome the fact that the push for the reform of the Security Council coming from Africa has had an impact and has given some impetus to the intergovernmental negotiations process that has been looking at the reforms  We will continue working with progressive States towards the expansion of representation  Another critical matter that needs attention is the selection of the SecretaryGeneral  who is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council  A review of that process is necessary so as to enable more meaningful participation on the part of the General Assembly in the process  The President has identified human rights  governance  the rule of law  and the gender aspects of the work of the United Nations as important areas of focus for the seventieth session of the General Assembly  We have to build upon the initial work undertaken in the development of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in  to enhance protection in areas such as racism  discrimination against women and the promotion of the rights of the child and the rights of people with disabilities  We also believe that the United Nations human rights system  especially its Human Rights Council  should ensure a balance between civil and political rights  on the one hand  and economic  social and cultural rights  including the right to development  on the other  The Human Rights Council must also be seen as an independent and impartial mechanism for the entrenchment of a human rights culture throughout the world  It should avoid the pitfalls of its predecessor  the Commission on Human Rights  which was beset by politicization and was caught up in the divide between developed and developing countries  This year also marks  years since the adoption of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  The year  also marks  years since the adoption of the Freedom Charter in South Africa  which embodies the fundamental principles and values that are now enshrined in our Constitution  South Africa will continue to champion efforts in the United Nations human rights system to combat the scourges of racism  xenophobia  racial discrimination and related intolerances and to support work aimed at the promotion of substantive global equality  The seventieth general debate takes place in the context of growing international concern about the rise of violent extremism  terrorism and untold brutality  which we strongly condemn  We welcome the meetings that will take place on the margins of the General Assembly to review the progress made in countering terrorism in the Middle East and North Africa  We wish to emphasize that the Security Council must take into account the views of the African continent and its subregional organizations when dealing with conflicts in Africa in future  The current situation in Libya and the Sahel region is a direct consequence of the failure of some members of the Council to heed informed counsel from the African Union  The norm of responsibility to protect was abused for narrow political interests that had nothing to do with the fundamental aspects of the prevention of mass atrocities  The current refugee crisis in Europe is  sadly  the direct result of the militarization of civilian unrest  which included the massive arming of civilians and opposition groups in Libya  Syria and other affected countries  That kind of problem is a deliberately man made problem  and it is critical that  in discussing violent extremism and terrorism in parts of Africa and the Middle East  we look into the root causes of the problem and not just the symptoms  Also requiring our serious reflection is the regime change doctrine and its role in perpetuating conflicts and instability in various parts of our continent and the world  We welcome the recently signed peace agreement between the parties in South Sudan and urge the United Nations and all stakeholders to support the Sudanese people as they work to resolve their challenges  We reaffirm our support for the people of Western Sahara and urge the international community to encourage their struggle for selfdetermination  freedom  human rights and dignity  We also welcome the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States and the release of the Cuban Five  We reiterate our call for the lifting of the economic and financial embargo to help the Cuban people to gain their economic freedom  We acknowledge the contribution of His Holiness Pope Francis to the CubanUnited States normalization process  We also warmly welcome the contribution of the Holy Father generally to the global pursuit of peace  justice and the end of poverty and suffering  as eloquently expressed in the General Assembly and globally  We commend the United Nations for the key role that it has played in peacekeeping and urge that resources be prioritized for this core role of the United Nations  especially in Africa  The failure of the parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach an agreement at the  Review Conference   in the year that marks  years since the first atomic bombs were detonated in Japan   is a major setback to our commitment to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction  especially nuclear weapons  There can be no safe hands where nuclear weapons are concerned  The humanitarian consequences of a possible detonation of a nuclear weapon  whether intentional or accidental  will be catastrophic for humankind  We welcome the recent agreement reached on the Iranian nuclear programme and the recognition of the right of Iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy  The seventieth session of the General Assembly has seen the adoption of the post development agenda  The outcome document represents a victory for the developing world  as it affirms that the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  resolution    should build on the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals  Additionally  while the  Agenda is universal in its scope in that the Sustainable Development Goals adopted apply to both developed and developing countries  there is also a clear recognition of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities  The Agenda also contains a specific Goal on achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls  That is all the more appropriate given that this year is the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action and the fifteenth anniversary of Security Council resolution      on women  peace and security  As the initiator of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action   thanks to which the current round of negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC  is taking place   South Africa has a special interest in and commitment to the success of the Paris session of the Conference of the Parties later this year  We require the fulfilment of all three parts of the Durban mandate  namely  the closing of the current ambition gap in the pre period through the honouring of existing legal obligations by developed countries and enhanced action  the entry into force of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol  and the adoption in Paris of a new agreement for the post period that contains all the essential elements  including the means of implementation and the measures relating to loss  damage and response  We seek a fair  ambitious and legally binding agreement in Paris that is applicable to all parties  In addition  South Africa  as Chair of the G plus China  would not be able to accept a Paris package that is hollow or weak on finance  South Africa has submitted its intended nationally determined contribution to the UNFCCC secretariat ahead of the  October deadline  signalling our readiness for Paris  We join the world in celebrating the  years of existence of the United Nations  As we mark this historic anniversary  the reform of the Security Council and the strengthening of the General Assembly and other organs remain a paramount concern  By the end of this session  we should be in a position to adopt a road map  with clear and implementable time frames  on the priorities of this Organization as well as on its reform  We need to do this in order for the United Nations to remain a relevant force and a force for change in the world  In conclusion  let me express our deep appreciation of the offer made by China when it was addressing the Assembly  an offer that must go through the United Nations  China spelled out the support it intended to give to Africa  a total of  million of free military assistance to the African Union over the next five years to support the establishment of the African Standby Force and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises  We would like to underline our gratitude to China</td>\n",

       "      <td>I would like to begin by thanking the SecretaryGeneral and by expressing my gratitude for the convening of this important session  at which we mark the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency Mr  Mogens Lykketoft on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session  I am confident that  coming as he does from the great country of Denmark  he will preside over our meetings with great success  I would also like to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr  Sam Kutesa of the Republic of Uganda for successfully presiding over the Assembly at its previous session  I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to deliver my first address to this gathering of world leaders  I should recall that  almost a year ago  my country found itself at a crossroads following the demise  on  October   of our fifth President  Mr  Michael Chilufya Sata   may his soul rest in peace  I was elected President of the Republic of Zambia in the subsequent election  which took place on  January  Building on my country s impeccable record in the area of democracy and good governance  the election was described as transparent  peaceful  free and fair  reflecting our commitment to internationally accepted standards for peaceful changes of Government and popular participation in shaping a country s destiny  I would therefore like to thank the people of Zambia for being true champions of democracy  As we meet today  I also feel duty bound to thank the international community for its unflinching solidarity during that very challenging time of the past year  This year is an important one for the General Assembly  as we commemorate the  years of existence of the United Nations  In our deliberations  therefore  it is imperative that we take stock of the collective successes as well as the challenges of the past seven decades  in order to improve the performance of this noble Organization  I am optimistic that the seventieth session will set a tone for the future and meet the expectations of the international community as a whole  Zambia is proud to be part of the global endeavour to foster the mandate of the United Nations to promote peace  security and respect for human rights and to ensure progress in development for all  We are concerned  however  that the gears for advancing the three pillars of the Charter of the United Nations are moving at a very slow pace  which has the potential to negate the gains we have achieved so far  It is therefore important that we enhance our concerted efforts to address areas of concern  We have just adopted the world s quintessential development blueprint in the form of the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  resolution     centred on humankind  the environment and the creation of peaceful societies  Those core elements will guide its implementation  supported by the principle of leaving no one behind  I have been encouraged by the focus on development that has characterized the global discourse in recent years  as the  Agenda has evolved  The development lessons of the Millennium Development Goals and the cumulative experience of the  years of the United Nations should serve as a springboard for our ambitions  Let us therefore ensure the successful implementation and attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals  SDGs   I am confident that the invaluable lessons learned will set us on a trajectory that must inevitably lead to a safer  more inclusive  cleaner and more prosperous world  In the  years of the existence of the United Nations  the inequality gap among and between nations has continued to widen  as poverty and youth unemployment have threatened the prospects for peace  security and development  My Government looks forward to the comprehensive implementation of the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  which promotes poverty eradication and the creation of employment opportunities for young people and women  especially in rural communities  Over the past  years  the global community has become more united than ever before in its quest to push boundaries in order to attain peace and security  yet it is as divided as ever  if not more so  on the question of who makes decisions on global peace and security  The  years of the existence of the United Nations have seen more conflicts in Africa than on any other continent  and yet those  years have been characterized by Africa s absolute exclusion from decisionmaking in the Security Council  despite the fact that a significant part of the Council s agenda       A  PV  concerns the African continent  In the  years of the existence of the United Nations  Africa remains the only continent not represented among the permanent members of the Security Council  Goal  of the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  resolution    on reducing inequality among countries will not be achieved without eradicating the inequality among countries in the Security Council  The United Nations must  therefore  redouble its efforts to implement Security Council reform in order to ensure that Africa can take its rightful place among the community of nations and contributes equitably and effectively to global peace and security  Zambia has continued and will continue to offer its resources for peacekeeping  including the deployment earlier this year of a large contingent of troops to the Central African Republic  Zambia comes with a long history of involvement in conflict prevention  peacekeeping and peacebuilding  As a landlocked country  our independence was incomplete as long as we remained surrounded by nations still fighting their liberation struggles  That gave impetus to our moral conviction to join in the liberation struggles in Africa  Since then  Zambia has continued to participate in peacebuilding initiatives and has supported peacekeeping efforts all around the world  We continue to share the global concerns at the unrelenting threats of terrorism  as it mostly affects the safety of noncombatants and civilian populations  I have been encouraged by the focus on development that has characterized global discourse during the past year  notably through discussions on the SDGs and the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  Zambia has been a beneficiary of various initiatives aimed at facilitating the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals  which arose from the collective resolve of the generation of world leaders at the turn of the millennium  Indeed  most of our countries have continued to face serious challenges in the quest to foster development and improve the quality of life of our people  The challenges are numerous  including energy shortages and the effects of climate change  The two are inseparable on the development agenda for countries such as Zambia that rely heavily on hydropower generation  The changing rainfall pattern has adversely affected powergeneration capacities in most of our countries  This year  Zambia is experiencing an unprecedented energy crisis  which has already cost the nation dearly in terms of productivity  jobs and revenue  Beyond the economic limitations  the social ramifications are equally devastating to the country  It is therefore important that much effort be exerted to develop mitigation strategies to counter the effects of climate change  Furthermore  developing countries are still grappling with other challenges  such as poverty  high unemployment   particularly among the youth   skewed industrial development  low intraregional trade  inadequate infrastructure  low productivity in agriculture and livestock  poor quality health services and the challenges of access to quality education  As we move forward  it is important for us to acknowledge the realities and imperatives of the world today and to renew our common resolve to sustain the core principles of our Organization as the United Nations  We should redouble our efforts  by harnessing our individual strengths in order to collectively address the rather complex challenges that confront us in our increasingly globalized and interdependent world  Given the demographic nature of our communities  poverty remains a real concern  particularly in rural areas  In Zambia   per cent of the people in rural areas depend on agriculture for their livelihood  Agriculture is one of my Government s priority areas in the county s efforts to diversify the economy  apart from mining  The Government is therefore devising interventions aimed at improving capacities and adding value for both subsistence farmers and commercial farmers  Our interventions  notably the Farmer Input Support Programme  the Irrigation Development and Support Project  and other credit schemes  need additional support in order to exploit the full potential of that giant industry  We also seek to strengthen partnerships to enable the improvement of services in such areas as providing extension services  improving access to market information and facilitating the physical transfer of produce to markets  A key element of Zambia s development agenda is industrialization  In that regard  my Government has devised measures to encourage and support the development of appropriate industries  mainly in valueadded industries  in order to spur structural economic transformation and increase privatesector participation  The primary focus in that area has been on areas with more backward and forward linkages so as to catapult the Zambian economy to higher levels of growth  leveraging regional value chains so as to    A  PV     expand trade  attract foreign direct investment  create employment  reduce poverty  promote sustainable development and thereby empower our people  Financing is one of the major challenges that faces developing countries  We need external resources to bridge the gap in the funds required to finance development projects  It is in that light that the United Nations third International Conference on Financing for Development  held in Addis Ababa in July to develop strategies for financing development  was most welcome  The Conference recommended several measures meant to bridge the financing gap  including the need to exploit new sources of finance and improve tax administration systems  which would be supplemented by international support  We know that putting the appropriate infrastructure in place is very important in our quest to expand intraAfrica trade  bolster our productive capacities and enhance Africa s competitiveness in the global market  In that regard  we must quickly identify sources to raise the  billion Africa needs annually to finance its infrastructure development  It is equally important  from the perspective of landlocked developing countries  to remain committed to implementing the decisions of the  Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade   In keeping with that commitment  Zambia was privileged to host a highlevel meeting on the followup to the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries  held in Livingstone in June  I was honoured to officiate at the Conference and hope that the Assembly finds the time to review the outcome document  entitled  Livingstone Call for Action   Special attention should be paid to gender and women s empowerment  The International Conference on Population and Development Beyond  Global Review Report  published in June   indicates that  per cent of women have been victims of gender based violence  Indeed  Zambia acknowledges that the problem extends to most nations  including our own  To that end  we are already implementing important interventions to curb that scourge  Our approach to development will not be limited to the economy but will continue to focus on all pillars of development  I welcome the fact that our traditional leaders  the United Nations system and civil society have all been seamlessly working with Governments in fighting for gender equality for our women and girls  One of the most important programmes  and one in which I have been engaged as a designated champion  is the  He For She  campaign  which seeks to address issues of genderbased violence  That project was initiated by UNWomen in September  with the aim of addressing incidents of genderbased violence  In a few days  my Government will also launch the United Statessupported  From Boys to Men  project  which targets the toyearold age group and is aimed at encouraging the development of a nonviolent generation  In our determination to bridge the gap between the sexes  a vigorous campaign is under way to strengthen the education of girls by encouraging them to complete their schooling and unlock their developmental potential instead of being pushed into child  early or forced marriages  The situation of our young people remains daunting  with unemployment one of the major challenges they face  To address that situation  my Government recently launched a national youth policy that seeks to lay a foundation for interventions of various kinds aimed at supporting the development of a vibrant and productive generation  We hope to create   jobs over the next five years  an effort that will depend heavily on the privatesectorled job market  We are also making efforts to address the specific social disadvantages of the most marginalized members of our society  including the disabled  We want to ensure that they can realize their potential and serve in national development efforts in the same way as anyone else  The challenges are many  but they are not insurmountable  The United Nations has been a key ally in addressing some of those problems  and indeed  to a large extent  the story of Zambia is the story of the United Nations  I am confident that through our concerted and collective efforts  determination and hard work  coupled with able and visionary leadership  we shall indeed overcome  I look forward to working with everyone here so as to ensure that our shared solutions are brought forward and implemented in the spirit of this Organization</td>\n",

people and woman   especially in rural community   over the past   year   the global community have become more united than ever before in its quest to push boundary in order to attain peace and security   yet it be as divide as ever   if not more so   on the question of who make decision on global peace and security   the   year of the existence of the United Nations have see more conflict in Africa than on any other continent   and yet those   year have be characterize by Africa s absolute exclusion from decisionmake in the Security Council   despite the fact that a significant part of the Council s agenda        A   PV   concern the african continent   in the   year of the existence of the United Nations   Africa remain the only continent not represent among the permanent member of the Security Council   Goal   of the   Agenda for Sustainable Development   resolution     on reduce inequality among country will not be achieve without eradicate the inequality among country in the Security Council   the United Nations must   therefore   redouble its effort to implement Security Council reform in order to ensure that Africa can take its rightful place among the community of nation and contribute equitably and effectively to global peace and security   Zambia have continue and will continue to offer its resource for peacekeeping   include the deployment early this year of a large contingent of troop to the Central African Republic   Zambia come with a long history of involvement in conflict prevention   peacekeeping and peacebuilde   as a landlocked country   our independence be incomplete as long as we remained surround by nation still fight their liberation struggle   that give impetus to our moral conviction to join in the liberation struggle in Africa   since then   Zambia have continue to participate in peacebuilde initiative and have support peacekeeping effort all around the world   we continue to share the global concern at the unrelenting threat of terrorism   as it mostly affect the safety of noncombatant and civilian population   I have be encourage by the focus on development that have characterize global discourse during the past year   notably through discussion on the sdg and the   Agenda for Sustainable Development   Zambia have be a beneficiary of various initiative aim at facilitate the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals   which arise from the collective resolve of the generation of world leader at the turn of the millennium   indeed   most of our country have continue to face serious challenge in the quest to foster development and improve the quality of life of our people   the challenge be numerous   include energy shortage and the effect of climate change   the two be inseparable on the development agenda for country such as Zambia that rely heavily on hydropower generation   the change rainfall pattern have adversely affect powergeneration capacity in most of our country   this year   Zambia be experience an unprecedented energy crisis   which have already cost the nation dearly in term of productivity   job and revenue   beyond the economic limitation   the social ramification be equally devastating to the country   it be therefore important that much effort be exert to develop mitigation strategy to counter the effect of climate change   furthermore   develop country be still grapple with other challenge   such as poverty   high unemployment    particularly among the youth    skew industrial development   low intraregional trade   inadequate infrastructure   low productivity in agriculture and livestock   poor quality health service and the challenge of access to quality education   as we move forward   it be important for we to acknowledge the reality and imperative of the world today and to renew our common resolve to sustain the core principle of our Organization as the United Nations   we should redouble our effort   by harness our individual strength in order to collectively address the rather complex challenge that confront we in our increasingly globalized and interdependent world   give the demographic nature of our community   poverty remain a real concern   particularly in rural area   in Zambia    per cent of the people in rural area depend on agriculture for their livelihood   Agriculture be one of my Government s priority area in the county s effort to diversify the economy   apart from mine   the Government be therefore devise intervention aim at improve capacity and add value for both subsistence farmer and commercial farmer   our intervention   notably the Farmer Input Support Programme   the Irrigation Development and Support Project   and other credit scheme   need additional support in order to exploit the full potential of that giant industry   we also seek to strengthen partnership to enable the improvement of service in such area as provide extension service   improve access to market information and facilitate the physical transfer of produce to market   a key element of Zambia s development agenda be industrialization   in that regard   my government have devise measure to encourage and support the development of appropriate industry   mainly in valueadde industry   in order to spur structural economic transformation and increase privatesector participation   the primary focus in that area have be on area with more backward and forward linkage so as to catapult the zambian economy to high level of growth   leverage regional value chain so as to     A   pv      expand trade   attract foreign direct investment   create employment   reduce poverty   promote sustainable development and thereby empower our people   financing be one of the major challenge that face develop country   we need external resource to bridge the gap in the fund require to finance development project   it be in that light that the United Nations third International Conference on Financing for Development   hold in Addis Ababa in July to develop strategy for finance development   be most welcome   the Conference recommend several measure mean to bridge the financing gap   include the need to exploit new source of finance and improve tax administration system   which would be supplement by international support   we know that put the appropriate infrastructure in place be very important in our quest to expand intraafrica trade   bolster our productive capacity and enhance Africa s competitiveness in the global market   in that regard   we must quickly identify source to raise the   billion Africa need annually to finance its infrastructure development   it be equally important   from the perspective of landlocked develop country   to remain committed to implement the decision of the   Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the decade    in keeping with that commitment   Zambia be privileged to host a highlevel meeting on the followup to the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries   hold in Livingstone in June   I be honour to officiate at the conference and hope that the Assembly find the time to review the outcome document   entitle   Livingstone Call for Action    special attention should be pay to gender and woman s empowerment   the International Conference on Population and Development Beyond   Global Review Report   publish in June    indicate that   per cent of woman have be victim of gender base violence   indeed   Zambia acknowledge that the problem extend to most nation   include our own   to that end   we be already implement important intervention to curb that scourge   our approach to development will not be limit to the economy but will continue to focus on all pillar of development   I welcome the fact that our traditional leader   the United Nations system and civil society have all be seamlessly work with government in fighting for gender equality for our woman and girl   one of the most important programme   and one in which I have be engage as a designate champion   be the   he for she   campaign   which seek to address issue of genderbased violence   that project be initiate by UNWomen in September   with the aim of address incident of genderbased violence   in a few day   my Government will also launch the United Statessupported   from boy to Men   project   which target the toyearold age group and be aim at encourage the development of a nonviolent generation   in our determination to bridge the gap between the sexes   a vigorous campaign be under way to strengthen the education of girl by encourage they to complete their schooling and unlock their developmental potential instead of be push into child   early or force marriage   the situation of our young people remain daunt   with unemployment one of the major challenge they face   to address that situation   my Government recently launch a national youth policy that seek to lay a foundation for intervention of various kind aim at support the development of a vibrant and productive generation   we hope to create    job over the next five year   an effort that will depend heavily on the privatesectorled job market   we be also make effort to address the specific social disadvantage of the most marginalized member of our society   include the disabled   we want to ensure that they can realize their potential and serve in national development effort in the same way as anyone else   the challenge be many   but they be not insurmountable   the United Nations have be a key ally in address some of those problem   and indeed   to a large extent   the story of Zambia be the story of the United Nations   I be confident that through our concerted and collective effort   determination and hard work

       "      <td>Allow me at the outset to extend to Mr  Mogens Lykketoft my warm congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session  He assumes this office at an historic moment when the United Nations has just adopted an ambitious agenda for the future of humankind  The task ahead needs all hands on deck and he can count on our cooperation and support during his presidency  I wish to commend Mr  Sam Kutesa  a distinguished son of Africa  for the dynamism with which he steered this body over the past year  We particularly appreciated his leadership in promoting inclusive dialogue and seeking consensus on the many sensitive issues that he presided over during his tenure of office  The theme of this session    The United Nations at   the road ahead for peace  security and human rights    aptly complements the deliberations of the Summit meeting on the post development agenda  It is our expectation that the United Nations will draw from its seven decades of experiences to give birth to a new era of peace  equality and justice  a new era that recognizes and fosters the commonality of our common fate through renewed international cooperation and solidarity  The African Union welcomes the priorities the President has proposed  for they go in tandem with our own development plan  the Agenda   which recognizes the intrinsic and inextricable linkages between peace  security  development and the full realization of human rights  The African Union Constitutive Act recognizes that while peace and security are imperative for our progress  conflict is a major impediment to the socio economic advancement and integration of the continent  Consequently  the Common African Position on the post development agenda designates peace and security as one of its six key pillars  It is a top priority for us  The prevalence of peace not only creates conditions conducive to development  but also ensures that the maximum possible resources can be dedicated to development programmes and projects  We welcome and encourage the continued cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union  principally through the latter s Peace and Security Council  in advancing peace and security in Africa  In January  the leaders of the African Union adopted Agenda  as our continent s plan to accelerate deepened economic integration of our countries and regions  Its main objective is to improve the well being of the continent s citizenry through sustained and balanced economic growth  At the African Union Summit in Pretoria  South Africa  in June this year we agreed on the Agenda s first year development plan  During these initial  years  the flagship programmes will include the creation of a continental freetrade area  an African centre for disease control  a panAfrica university of science and technology to develop skills for the value addition and beneficiation of the continent s vast mineral resources  a single aviation market  a highspeed train  and a panAfrican enetwork  The successful implementation of Agenda  calls not just for the commitment of African stakeholders but also for the support and engagement of partners beyond the borders of our continent  Africa is not looking for handouts  Rather it is looking for partners in massive infrastructure development  in creating and exploiting the value chains from its Godgiven natural resources  and in improving the quality of life of the continent s citizens  The entire world stands to benefit more from an economically empowered African continent than from one emasculated by deprivation and with an over dependence on others  Adaptation to change is the most crucial ingredient for the vibrancy and effectiveness of any organization  including the United Nations  While the world has drastically changed since   the United Nations  and indeed the global governance architecture  remains mired in a long bygone era  This archaic hierarchy among nations threatens to erode the confidence and support that the United Nations commands among the majority  but disadvantaged  of its membership  We are disappointed that we have lost the opportunity of this anniversary to address this burning issue of Security Council reform in a manner that satisfies the just demands and expectations of the majority among us  I wish to reiterate our strong attachment to Africa s common position on Security Council reform contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration  I call on all genuine friends of Africa and all those who value justice  fairness and democracy to support Africa s just and reasonable proposals  We equally call for the revitalization of the General Assembly  the sole universally representative and democratic organ of the United Nations  so that it can effectively carry out its Chartermandated responsibilities  Accordingly  we fully support the call for inclusivity and transparency in selecting our Organization s SecretaryGeneral by ensuring that the General Assembly plays a more significant role in that process  After all  the SecretaryGeneral is at the service of all the Member States  and not only that of an exclusive  privileged few  Respecting and upholding human rights is the obligation of all States and is enshrined in the United Nations Charter  Nowhere does the Charter arrogate the right to some to sit in judgement over others in carrying out this universal obligation  In that regard  we reject the politicization of this important issue and the application of double standards to victimize those who dare think and act independently of the selfanointed prefects of our time  We equally reject attempts to prescribe new rights that are contrary to our values  norms  traditions and beliefs  We are not gays  Cooperation and respect for each other will advance the cause of human rights worldwide  confrontation  vilification and double standards will not  Selfdetermination and independence are intrinsic and fundamental rights that should be enjoyed by all peoples everywhere  without distinction  We are deeply concerned by the continued denial of this basic right to the Saharan people  We urge the United Nations to expeditiously finalize what must be done to conclude the decolonization of the Western Sahara  In the Middle East  the suffering of the Palestinian people continues unabated  What does Mr  Obama say about that  We reiterate our unwavering support for the just cause of the Palestinian people  Do we agree  Mr  United States  We also reiterate that lasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved only through negotiations to achieve a twoState solution based on the pre borders  We are concerned at the increase in tensions in that region and urge the United Nations to assume its responsibility and bring an end to this senseless conflict  The promotion of gender equality is critical for the realization of the post development agenda  The African Union has designated  as the Year of Women s Empowerment and Development towards Agenda  in order to mobilize our individual and collective actions around this key issue  Gender equality and women s empowerment are central to the achievement of human development  progress and the elimination of the scourge of poverty and deprivation  We must continue to build upon the achievements that have been realized since the  Fourth World Conference on Women and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action  The growing list of phenomena that neither respect nor know any borders makes it imperative that we mobilize all mechanisms for cooperation to effectively overcome them  Terrorism and extremist violence  communicable diseases such as HIV and AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria  bird flu  and Ebola cannot be overcome singlehandedly  The United Nations and its specialized agencies are the place and the mechanism for this indispensable and necessary cooperation  For some months now  we have watched heartbreaking and harrowing scenes of desperate refugees seeking to enter Europe in search of safety and shelter from the ravages of conflict in their own homelands  We have also read of the tragedy and loss of life in the Mediterranean  The majority of the affected people are from Syria or from other countries devastated by conflict and instability  induced in great part by the destabilizing policies of external forces  This tragic situation could have been avoided through respect for the independence of other countries and noninterference in their internal affairs  In the case of Libya  we are witnessing the results of abusing the authority of the Security Council and ignoring the opinion of regional organizations  in this instance the African Union  that are supposed to be the partners of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security  My country  Zimbabwe  is committed to a fair  just and effective United Nations in which multilateralism  inclusivity and transparency replace unilateralism  exclusion and backroom deals  The Charter of the United Nations is built on the bedrock of the sovereign equality and independence of its Members  without distinction as to their geographical size  economic might or any other endowments or qualifications  We are deeply attached to these principles and call on other Members of the United Nations to be similarly disposed  The United Nations was set up  among other purposes  to  develop friendly relations among nations   Zimbabwe desires and is committed to nurturing friendly relations with other nations  but it cannot tolerate interference in its domestic affairs  We invite other countries with which we may have differences of whatever nature   including the United States and the NATO Powers   to eschew threats  pressures and punitive actions in favour of reconciliation  friendship and dialogue  I therefore denounce in the strongest terms the illegal sanctions that are imposed on my country by the European Union and the United States of America and call for their immediate and unconditional removal  We do not know what wrong we have done to the United States  I would kindly ask it to leave us free and independent to do our own thing  Once more  I put on record that my country is desirous to live in harmony with all countries big and small  We have peace in Zimbabwe just now  We do not want war  We do not want interference  We do not want to hear of regime change at all  The seventieth anniversary of our Organization has been marked by the adoption of a farreaching Agenda that has the potential to drastically transform our world in all aspects  We are under no illusion about the challenges that lie ahead  but we are not discouraged  either  Humankind has  over the epochs  demonstrated an immense tenacity in overcoming inertia and resistance to change  Now is our time to leave our own positive mark on the history of human development and interaction  Posterity expects no less from us</td>\n",

       "0     May I first convey to our President the congratulations of the Albanian delegation on his election to the Presidency of the twentyfifth session of the General Assembly    In taking up the work on the agenda of the twenty fifth session of the General Assembly  which is being held on the eve of the twentyfifth anniversary of the coming into force of the Charter of the United Nations  the peaceloving Member States would have wished to be in a position to present on this occasion some picture of positive and satisfactory activity on the part of the United Nations  The Albanian delegation  for its part  would have taken great pleasure in drawing up such a balance sheet of activities covering a quarter of a century  which is certainly no short period in the life of an international organization  Unfortunately  this is not the situation  Created on the day after victory had been achieved over the Powers of the Rome BerlinTokyo Axis and conceived in the spirit of the principles which predominated in the war of the antiFascist coalition  the Organization awakened in the whole of progressive humanity the hope that it would serve as an important factor in creating better international conditions in order to favor the cause of freedom  peace and world security  But its activities and a number of events which occurred in the world arena during that period disappointed the hopes of peoples  The United Nations  far from having contributed  as required by the fundamental provisions of the Charter  to the consolidation of international peace and security and the liberation struggle of peoples  has on the contrary  under the diktat of the imperialist powers  the United States of America foremost among them  embarked on a path diametrically opposed to those principles  and has served as an instrument favoring their policy of pillage  oppression and aggression against peaceloving peoples and countries    The utilization of the United Nations to serve this policy has resulted in the Organization not only not having been able to stay the hand of those committing aggression in many parts of the world  but having frequently helped the aggressors  its activity in this direction going so far  moreover  that under the flag of the United Nations there have been perpetrated some of the most barbarous aggressions experienced since the end of the Second World War  such as  among others  the armed aggressions in Korea and in the Congo    The whole of progressive mankind recalls with admiration the heroic struggle which  under the direction of the great Stalin  the Soviet Union waged  in cooperation with the AngloAmerican coalition  to defend the peaceful peoples and countries against Hitlerite Germany  The historic and decisive victories of the Red Army over the Nazi hordes and the great role played by the Soviet Union during the Second World War aroused great enthusiasm among peoples and awakened in them the hope for a better future  They followed with great interest and with particular joy the unflinching struggle which was waged by the Leninist Soviet Union in the world arena  as well as by its authentic representatives here in this Organization  in order to defend their vital interests and to sustain their legitimate struggle for liberation from the imperialist  colonialist and racist yoke  But following the usurpation of power in that country by the Khrushchev clique  the situation changed completely  and the struggle of the Soviet Union against American imperialism and its allies was replaced by the holy alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States against the peaceloving and freedomloving peoples and countries  It is thus that  so far as the United Nations is concerned  it has become a center of bargaining  maneuvering and underhand manipulations on the part of the American imperialists and the Soviet socialimperialists  designed to lull the vigilance of peoples and to disguise as best they can their policy of world hegemony    All this has had well known consequences for the United Nations  which have been particularly damaging to its authority and its ability to play the part which is incumbent upon it under the Charter  But  at the same time  this negative activity has helped peoples to realize better the nature of the two imperialist Powers and what can be expected from the United Nations in the present circumstances where it is being manipulated by those two Powers  It has  in particular  become obvious to them that all the initiatives and proposals of American governing circles and of Moscow revisionists in connexion with disarmament and all the agreements which they seek to impose on other States in this field  with respect to both conventional armaments and nuclear armaments  are designed solely to disarm peaceloving countries and to ensure for themselves the nuclear monopoly and the largest possible quantity of armaments of all sorts in order to subjugate peoples and to enslave the world which they wish to divide between them  Peoples are becoming more aware than ever that the only way for them to break free from every imperialist  colonialist and racist yoke is through armed struggle and trust in their own strength  while at the same time enjoying the solidarity and the support of all other freedomloving peoples and countries    One of the undeniable proofs that the United Nations has embarked on the road of violating the principles and spirit of the Charter is the withholding for  years of the legitimate rights of the People s Republic of China in this Organization  a circumstance which not only has brought about an abnormal situation without precedent in this Organization and constituted a severe blow to its prestige  but also has at the same time affected its capacity regarding the contribution which it should make to the settlement of the important problems of our time  none of which  as we well know  can be given a real solution without the participation of the great socialist China of  million people    Undoubtedly  such a state of affairs in this Organization does not discourage the Member States who espouse the fundamental principles of the Charter  On the contrary  trusting in their own strength and their own possibilities and encouraged by the development and the victories of the liberation struggle waged by peoples in all continents  they will redouble their efforts and cooperate more closely in order to wage a more effective battle against the policy of diktat and force which has been practiced by the two great imperialist Powers here in the United Nations or elsewhere in the world    The liberation movement at the world level against the imperialist and colonialist Powers is at present making new strides  The peoples have reacted to the policy of oppression and domination practiced by the imperialist Powers and their aggressions and plots  by strengthening their just struggle for independence and freedom and joining the ranks of the armed struggle against the aggressors  This is shown by the struggle of the heroic peoples of VietNam  Laos  Cambodia and other countries of IndoChina  the straggle of the people of Korea and other peoples of the Far East against the United States imperialists  their allies and their tools  the struggle of the valiant Palestinians and other Arab peoples against imperialistZionist aggression  the struggle of the peoples of Oman and Dhofar and the peoples of the Arabian Gulf to free themselves from the colonial yoke  the resistance of the peoples of Eastern Europe against the domination of the new imperialists of the Kremlin  the struggle of the African peoples of Mozambique  Angola  Guinea  Bissau   Namibia  Southern Rhodesia and South Africa against the colonial Powers  the settlers and their racist tools  the struggle of the people of Puerto Rico to free themselves from the imperialist yoke of the United States  as well as all those struggles that are being waged by peoples in various parts of the world  including that of the American people in the very citadel of imperialism  The imperialist Powers and their allies are suffering defeat after defeat  Powerful blows have been struck against them everywhere by the peoples that are struggling for their national independence  for their freedom and for their sacred and inalienable right to be masters of their own destiny    Panicstricken at the impetuous growth of the revolutionary struggle for the liberation of peoples and assailed by multiple internal and external difficulties  the two socalled superPowers  American imperialism and Soviet socialimperialism  which are at the head of all reactionary forces  are striving by all means in their power to face up to this desperate situation and to accelerate the implementation of their aggressive and warlike plans against peaceloving peoples and countries  These two Powers have during this period intensified their collusion and their criminal activities  using deceit and demagogy as well as various forms of pressure  force and armed aggression    Although split by numerous contradictions deriving from their imperialist nature  each trying to undermine the other and to evict the other from its political  economic and strategic positions  these two superPowers have a common hatred for the freedom of peoples and the socialist revolution  It is on that basis that rest their cooperation and their aggressive activities  their plans and their plots  which extend to all continents in conformity with their global counterrevolutionary strategy  which is designed to divide and dominate the world  The Glasborough policy is pursued uninterruptedly  and AmericanSoviet collusion has taken fresh steps forward  Under the guise of peaceful slogans for the  peaceful settlement  of conflicts which have been brought about precisely by the aggressions which they themselves have perpetrated or directed  for European  Asian or international  security  which is in fact nothing but the security of the imperialist order for disarmament  for  internationalism  which presupposes  limited sovereignty   or more exactly the subjugation of peoples and nations  as well as other slogans  they plot and they coordinate their positions and their activities regarding various problems which affect the interests of mankind as a whole  Using such slogans  they are hatching plans and trying to impose socalled peaceful settlements by means of which they are trying to repress the liberation struggle waged by peoples  they are concluding treaties which are both fraudulent and enslaving and they are trying to conclude new aggressive pacts which will be added to the pacts  blocs and military bases that are now in existence  they are exerting pressure of all sorts on the freedomloving peoples and countries that dare to resist them  they are carrying on the arms race and the preparations for a new war  they indulge in nuclear blackmail and fresh acts of aggression    In that connexion we can cite  simultaneously with the secret negotiations of the two Powers through diplomatic channels  the long meetings of their representatives in Helsinki and later in Vienna  meetings which certainly are not limited to the question of the  limitation of strategic arms   the socalled Rogers plan for a  peaceful settlement  of the Middle East problem  a plan which is the result of the American Soviet plot designed to stifle the legitimate liberation struggle of the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples  which is at the origin of the bloody events which have taken place recently in Jordan  Of a similar nature are the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on IndoChina and the meetings organized in Moscow and elsewhere with representatives of the reactionary regimes in Asia to bring about a  peaceful settlement  of that problem a settlement which they believe will lead to the capitulation of the peoples of VietNam  Laos and Cambodia the travels of high emissaries of those two Powers in Asia and their efforts to create there new aggressive pacts in accordance with the Brezhnev plan for the  collective security of Asia  and the Nixon plan to pit Asiatics against Asiatics  plans which have been concerted between those two Powers and are designed first and foremost to create a circle of fire around the People s Republic of China  In the same category we should mention the enslaving SovietCzechoslovak treaty as well as the MoscowBonn treaty  which among other things tramples under foot the sovereign rights of the German people of the Democratic Republic of Germany and which  together with the SovietAmerican project on socalled European security  relates to the spheres of influence of the two Powers in Europe and their rearguard activities on that continent in order to implement their counterrevolutionary plans in Asia  Africa and elsewhere    In order to bring about this great antipopular conspiracy  the American and Soviet imperialists are applying a series of political  economic and military measures  such as intensifying the imperialist American aggression in Laos and the new aggression against Cambodia  plots and wiles designed to divide the Arab peoples and countries and plunge them into bloody and fratricidal conflict and to repress by all means possible  including armed force  the legitimate struggle of the heroic people of Palestine  Of a similar nature also are the threats and the measures taken by the Soviet revisionists against the peoples of Eastern European countries  including the military maneuvers of Soviet occupation forces in Czechoslovakia  carried out last August to intimidate the people on the eve of the second anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia    Thus the two Powers stop at nothing to realize their imperialist plans to stifle the revolutionary struggle of peaceloving peoples and countries  to establish their domination of the world and to arrogate to themselves the role of international police in order to decide in their own good time the fate of humanity    However  those are castles in the air  The wheel of history cannot be turned backwards  The era when the fate of peoples and of small countries was decided by the great imperialist Powers has gone for ever  The more the imperialists intensify their aggressive activities  the more the peoples strengthen their own struggle and the more the peoples strengthen their own struggle and the more closely they become united in the vast front of the armed struggle against the common enemy  Never will the peoples renounce their legitimate struggle to win back their vital rights  Despite temporary vicissitudes  their struggle is on the whole increasing and being strengthened and it appears now more than  ever before that a storm of liberation is breaking throughout Asia  Africa and elsewhere  a storm which will completely annihilate  in spite of underhanded maneuvers and repressions  imperialist and colonialist domination in whatever form it may exist    A recent example which is the best illustration of what awaits the American imperialists and their policy of intervention and war is the armed aggression they perpetrated against Cambodia last March  immediately after the coup d etat which they plotted in that country  Faced with an impasse because of the blows meted out in the struggle of the VietNamese people  the American aggressors sent their troops to Cambodia in order to implement there the  Nixon doctrine   which is designed to pit IndoChinese against IndoChinese  But this aggression  far from leading to the expected results  immediately met with the armed resistance of the people of Cambodia and the military solidarity of their VietNamese and Laotian brothers  powerfully supported by the great Chinese people as well as by the other peoples of Asia  It aroused energetic opposition on the part of peoples throughout the world  including the American people  Instead of stifling the liberation struggle of the VietNamese people  the aggression against Cambodia has spread throughout IndoChina the fire of the liberation and revolutionary struggle and has opened an even wider and deeper abyss  where American imperialism will finally be engulfed without any hope of being rescued    The success gained by the Cambodian people  under the leadership of the United Front of Cambodia  presided over by the Head of State  Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  in liberating a large part of the national territory from the aggressors and their lackeys  and the solidarity and new consolidation of the unity of the peoples of Cambodia  VietNam  Laos  the People s Republic of China  and the Democratic People s Republic of Korea  as well as of other revolutionary peoples in Asia  constitute a harsh blow to American imperialism  its collaborators and its lackeys    The American aggression against Cambodia is at the same time further proof of the collusion  at the expense of the people  of American imperialism with the revisionists of Moscow  the latter having adopted for this occasion an attitude similar to that of the American Government towards their aggression in Czechoslovakia  In particular  their refusal to recognize the Government of the United Front of Cambodia and the fact that they maintain normal diplomatic relations with the Lon Nol clique  an instrument of American imperialism supported by the puppets in Saigon and Seoul and even by the riffraff of Chiang Kaishek  as well as by international reaction as a whole  have once again revealed to world public opinion the true way with the camp of imperialism and reaction    The events of the current year in Cambodia and throughout IndoChina are of great importance for the IndoChinese peoples  which not only now have fresh proof of the obstinacy of American imperialism in carrying out acts of aggression and extending the war  but also now are in a better position to decide who is sincerely against the Yankee invader and who is with him  what the Soviet socialimperialists are and what great socialist China represents for them  Thus they realize once again that armed struggle is the only way to become free of the American aggressors    Despite the intensification of the efforts of the American imperialists  backed up by the Soviet revisionists  the valiant people of VietNam has thwarted all the plans and dangerous subterfuges designed to bring about its capitulation  Throughout South VietNam the people and its popular liberation army have taken up arms and struck crushing blows against the American aggressors  without giving them a moment of respite even in their military camps and bases  such as Da Nang  Ben Tre  Hue  the outskirts of Saigon and other parts of the country  The VietNamese people and its armed forces have  through their brilliant victories  tied down the American imperialists and their Saigon tools on the battlefield  These victories have shown undeniably that the efforts of the Yankee aggressors to escape inevitable defeat by extending the war have brought them only further irreparable reversals  The long revolutionary struggle has tempered the VietNamese people and has made it invincible  and by its determined and heroic struggle it will undoubtedly deal ever more crushing blows at American imperialism until it is completely defeated    The armed struggle for the national wellbeing of the peoples  of VietNam  Laos and Cambodia is constantly developing and being reinforced  it is now in a new stage  All the criminal plots which the American and Soviet imperialists have hatched in order to bring about a socalled peaceful settlement in IndoChina are doomed to complete failure  American imperialism is surrounded and defeated on all fronts  It is bound to be beaten    A typical case which shows the ferocity of the great AmericanSoviet conspiracy and the method of combining the most diverse means of action on the part of these imperialist Powers in order to carry out their policy of aggression and hegemony is the tragic and serious situation which prevails at the present time in the Near East  Concerned with implementing at all costs their common plan of sad repute baptized the Rogers plan designed to liquidate the Palestinian question and to divide the Arab peoples  to legalize and to reward the imperialistIsraeli aggression and to assure their imperialist interests in that area  the United States and the revisionist Soviet Union have plotted and put into effect the criminal collusion designed to stifle the Palestinian liberation movement through the reactionary regime of Jordan  thus trying to implement in the Near East the Nixon doctrine aimed at pitting Asians against Asians  Thus Jordanian reaction  serving American imperialism and Zionism  has used fire and sword  cannons  tanks and aviation against the heroic Palestinian fighters  Barbarous mass massacres have been perpetrated against the Palestinian population in Amman and elsewhere  At the same time  American imperialism  by statements from Nixon  Laird and other leaders  threatens to intervene in the internal affairs of the Arab countries and also threatens intervention by its Sixth Fleet  thus trying  as always  to play the role of international policeman to oppress peoples and suppress liberation struggles  to defend those cliques which are in their pockets  to defend their rapacious interests and to enslave peoples    American imperialism and world reaction consider as unfair the fraternal assistance given by Syria and Iraq to their Arab brothers who are struggling for a just cause  for their common cause  According to their logic they have the right and the freedom to intervene in all countries  everywhere  they can utilize tanks  cannons  and their war fleets to oppress and exploit the peoples of other countries  whereas Syria and Iraq are not entitled to come to the aid of their brothers    A wave of indignation and resentment has been unleashed throughout the progressive world  Quite rightly  the conscience of the Arab peoples has revolted against the treachery of the ruling clique in Jordan  And the world wonders  Why are tanks and bullets being used against the Palestinians  Is it because they are struggling for their liberty  for independence and for their sacred land    The peoples of all continents  profoundly indignant  are raising their voices in protest against the American imperialists and the Soviet socio imperialists  they are crying   Hands off the Palestinian people  Jordan  Syria and the other Arab countries     It is quite clear that the Palestinians are not obeying the  Rogers plan   They know full well that the American plan which is based on the Security Council resolution of  November  which  as we know  is itself the result of bargaining in the corridors between the Americans and the Soviets is designed  inter alia  to impose the elimination of the Palestinian question and the recognition of Israel s right to annex part of the territories which it invaded following its aggression of  June   This plan is also designed to reward the Zionist aggression by guaranteeing the existence of the State of Israel  which has taken over Arab territories which were also conquered by aggression  and also by recognizing other rights  Still worse  the two  superPowers  want to use the new ceasefire to continue the maneuvers and machinations which they have engaged in for the past three years in order once again to apply the tactics used by the imperialist powers after the Israeli aggression of   with the aim of putting off for ever the fulfillment of the sacred cause of the Arabs and thus making a fait accompli out of Israel s new occupation of their territories    No  the Arab people will never accept the United StatesSoviet diktat  which is designed to bring about their recapitulation  The Palestinian people and the other Arab peoples have rejected this plot  The efforts of the United States imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are in vain  The Arab peoples have a long experience  and they well know the Israeli aggressors and their masters  Never will they allow the two foreign Powers to decide their fate  whatever be their machinations and their sharing of roles  one presenting itself as the author of the criminal plan and the other giving that plan its support    The Arab peoples know full well that any proposal by the United States of America  which incited and assisted Israel to unleash aggression three years ago and which continues to provide Israel with armaments and encourages it to pursue its aggression and provocation  is designed simply to serve the imperialist interests of that Power in the area of the Near East  which is of great strategic importance and is rich in petroleum deposits  as well as the interests of Israel  its instrument  It is obvious and no one could deny it that without the assistance and support of the United States Israel would never have been in a position to initiate the aggression of June   and even less to continue to occupy the Arab territories    With regard to the Soviet revisionists  whatever mask they may put on  the Arab peoples know their faces  especially since the AmericanIsraeli aggression  and they are convinced that what they are interested in is penetrating into the Near East and the Mediterranean Basin and creating conditions favorable for their expansion in that area    The leader of the Albanian people  Comrade Enver Hoxha  referring to this problem in his statement of  September to the electors of Tirana  said  among other things   In the final analysis  the glorious revolutionary Arab peoples will not have the wool pulled over their eyes by the false friendship of Soviet social imperialism  which has taken advantage of their temporary difficulties to occupy their ports and their seas and to stifle their just liberation struggle against the Fascist Zionists and the United States imperialists  The two aggressive imperialist Powers are interested in planting their roots deep in the Near East and in ensuring that they have economic  political and military bases in the countries of the area  they want to oppress the peoples of those countries  lulling them with words  demoralizing them and corrupting them in order  finally  by the use of those bases  to go even further and invade Africa  Asia and other regions  starting colonial wars and plundering various continents   The Albanian people love the Arab peoples  because they are their brothers and their friends in good times and in bad  At this time of revolutionary and liberation struggles  we are at their side constantly  we have supported them and will continue to support them with all the means at our disposal  We have confidence in the triumph of the just cause for which they are fighting  But  in order to win an early victory over the common enemy  a unity that is hard as steel must be forged among all the Arab peoples in the armed struggle  The Zionists  the United States imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are seeking to divide the Arab peoples  to disarm them  to impose on them a peace that will be not theirs but their enemies   The arms that have been supplied to them are controlled by the Soviets  They have not been made available for the sacred Arab cause  but they are being used precisely to deceive the Arabs  to tie their hands and send them to the slaughterhouse  The  Rogers plan  of ill repute could more accurately be called the  RogersGromyko plan   The Arab peoples will certainly never fall into the terrible trap of that plan  The SovietUnited States armies can  by recourse to various insidious means  succeed in establishing themselves on both sides of the Suez Canal  in which case one may wonder what purpose the hardware supplied to the Arabs by the Soviets would serve  They have not heroically driven one imperialist from the Canal only to see it occupied now by two others   The clamoring of Day an are in harmony with the secret maneuvers of the Soviet revisionists  but the crackling of the heroic guns of the Arab Palestinian brothers is the most glorious reply  which will put down this great conspiracy of their enemies  Therefore  by all possible means  we must resolutely assist the partisan struggle of the Palestinians  a struggle that is now in the forefront of the more general battle which must be waged by Arab peoples on all fronts  Our Arab brothers will succeed in raising high the banner of the liberation struggle against the imperialists and Zionists  They will reduce to nothing the plans of the Soviet revisionists and all the provocations organized by the agencies of the CIA which are conspiring against the liberation struggle of the people of Palestine and all the Arab peoples     The Arab peoples have great revolutionary traditions and are known for their bravery and their liberation struggles  They know that they are not fighting against the Israeli aggressors only  but also against the two imperialist Powers which are mainly responsible for the situation in the Near East and  therefore  they will not allow themselves to fall into the traps of those Powers    The events of recent days in Jordan have confirmed that  as the leader of the Albanian people  Comrade Enver Hoxha  indicated in his statement of  September  Soviet socialimperialism is pursuing aims that have nothing in common with the interests of the Arab peoples  As on other occasions  they are not at all concerned with the fate of the Arab peoples  their sole aim is to consolidate their imperialist positions  In this particular case  the Soviet revisionist leaders  replying to Nixon s appeal to bring in Moscow s fire brigade to snuff out the revolutionary struggle of the Palestinians and other Arab peoples  to subjugate and enslave them  hastened to assume the role of firemen  Through their official declarations and propaganda organs  they came to the defense of the clique in power in Jordan  threatening the Palestinians with the slogan  Violence leads to violence   and addressing appeals to them and other Arab peoples asking them to give up their struggle  All those facts have served to make even more obvious to the Arab peoples the perfidious role being played by the social imperialists of Moscow and the real aims of the United StatesSoviet plan for the Near East    The Palestinians consider Jordan as their second homeland  They are not the cause of disruption in Jordan  rather  the fault lies with the reactionary regime in Jordan and King Hussein  who is in the service of United States imperialism and the  Rogers plan   On the contrary  the Palestinians in Jordan are the healthiest element in the common struggle to annihilate the common enemy    The Albanian people is profoundly indignant  strongly condemns those criminal acts and supports the heroic struggle of the Palestinians who are fighting for their sacred rights  We are convinced that  thanks to their resolute struggle and the strengthening of their unity in combat  and enjoying the support of their true friends  of all freedomloving peoples  they will expose the plots of their enemies and gain final victory over the aggressors    In the dealings between the United States and the Soviet Union  an important place is held also by the socalled question of the European security conference  proposed last year by the Kremlin leaders through their instrument of aggression  the Warsaw Treaty  There have been signs of intense activity this year  at the instigation of the two Powers  In accordance with their strategy to consolidate and subsequently extend their domination in Europe and carrying out their aggressive plans in other areas  United States and Soviet imperialists are particularly concerned with ensuring the success of that project  The Soviet revisionists in particular are showing special haste  which can be explained by their internal difficulties  the ever growing resistance of the countries of Eastern Europe to their policy of intervention and domination  by their plans and preparations for aggression directed towards Asia against the People s Republic of China  Of course the United States and its West em allies  particularly the Federal Republic of Germany  have not failed to do everything in their power to exploit this haste displayed by the Soviet revisionist leadership  in order to obtain the largest possible number of concessions on the German problem and that of West Berlin  as well as to ensure their economic  political and cultural penetration into the countries of Eastern Europe    Confronted by the insurmountable difficulties relating to the contradictions existing on many problems between the United States imperialists and the Soviet social imperialists as well as between them and the other European States  the two so called superPowers  in order to find a way out and mislead public opinion  have hit on the following formula to serve as a guiding principle for any agreement to be concluded in this framework   renunciation of the use of force in relations among the States of Europe   That misleading formula is designed in fact to give them something to cling to as they conclude these agreements  It was on the basis of that formula that the negotiations took place between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and Poland  as well as the long negotiations  of paramount importance  between the Soviet Union and West Germany    In all those activities the step which has had the greatest impact is the SovietWest German Treaty signed on  August last in Moscow  Intense propaganda attended the signing of that Treaty which was designed to present it as a historic event that would so they said bring peace to Europe and the integrity of its borders  Of course  such a campaign  regardless of the means used  could deceive only the naive  The peoples of Europe  who have had great experience  cannot be taken in by empty rhetoric  In particular  the propaganda statements of the Soviet and American leaders  and their supporters  cannot fail to recall the vast deceitful campaigns which accompanied the various stages of the plotting and compromises of the Western Powers with Hitlerian militarism  especially as regards the Munich Agreement of September     The Moscow Treaty is in fact no solution to the German problem  Indeed it is an open violation of the decisions on that problem adopted by the Allied Powers during the war  and of the oft renewed promises of the Soviet revisionist leadership to conclude a peace treaty with the two German States  or simply with the German Democratic Republic  and to defend the interests and sovereign rights of the latter  The Soviet revisionists have trampled under foot their commitments and their obligations  and thus committed a serious crime against the German people  against the German Democratic Republic  against peace and security in Europe and in the entire world  They have therefore assumed a heavy responsibility    The Moscow Treaty is in fact formal recognition of the entry of conquered Germany into the community of States  without their having signed a peace treaty  In the SovietGerman Treaty  apart from a few equivocal and questionable terms  there is no reference to recognition of borders between the two German States and the OderNeisse line dividing Poland and the German Democratic Republic as final and unchangeable borders  nor is there recognition by the Federal Republic of Germany of the German Democratic Republic as an independent  sovereign State fully enjoying all international rights  Even more important  the Chancellor of West Germany and the other leaders in Bonn have stated on more than one occasion  both before and after the signing of the Treaty  that they will never give up the idea of the reunification of the German nation  which to them means annexation of the German Democratic Republic  That position is again confirmed in the documents annexed to the Treaty  The Bonn Government thus is endeavoring to make the most out of this situation and to gain time in order to prepare to attain its  expansionist objectives in the most favorable circumstances  Thus  the Soviet revisionists have considered and used the German Democratic Republic as a bargaining counter in their dealings with the revengeseekers in Bonn  who still claim they have the right to speak and act on behalf of all of Germany  and there they are supported by the great Western Powers    As for the provisions of the Treaty concerning the renunciation of the use of force or the inviolability of borders  not only does this not mean that the borders are in fact unchangeable  but the people of Europe know full well the value of such commitments on the part of the German revengeseekers  for the memory of Hitler s nonaggression pacts with European States is still very fresh in their minds    Therefore  from all points of view  the Moscow Treaty undeniably provides Bonn s leaders with something to fall back on  It encourages their expansionist and revengeseeking plans and is at the same time a serious blow to the German Democratic Republic and all progressive peaceloving forces in Germany    No one can deny that  He creation of the German Democratic Republic was a great victory not only for the German people but for all the peoples of Europe  or that it is closely connected with peace and security in Europe  The strengthening of the German Democratic Republic and its recognition by all the States of Europe  on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality  are in the interest of their security  and are an essential condition for the settlement of the German problem and a sound basis for any sincere attempt to place the German people on the road to peace and democracy  cooperation  and friendship with all other European peoples  The agreement between the Soviet Union and West Germany is a dangerous step in the opposite direction  It cannot fail to be condemned  by all peace and freedomloving countries and peoples in Europe    It is obvious that the Moscow Treaty is first and foremost the result of bargaining between United States and Soviet imperialists  within the framework of the plans for their global strategy in Europe and other continents  But that Treaty is at the same time an agreement between two new imperialist Powers  Soviet social imperialism and West German militarism  and  as such  it is a serious threat not only to the European continent but also to other areas of the world which are the object of United StatesSoviet plans of aggression  Thus the leaders in Moscow have joined successive Governments in Washington in raising West Germany to the level of a main shock force  a principal partner of the two Powers in putting into effect their counterrevolutionary plans and their plans to subjugate all freedomloving peoples and countries  How can we fail on this occasion to remind the Assembly that similar plans were part of the policy of the Western Powers toward Hitler s Germany  but that proved very costly to them  for Hitler s Germany eventually turned on them    The MoscowBonn Treaty is undeniably a new link in the series of plots between the Soviets and the Americans against the world s peoples  and the serious threat entailed in this cannot escape the attention of any Government which is sincerely concerned with the vital interests of its people  national security and independence and world peace    The Albanian Government has always been in sympathy with the justified concern of the European States which are sincerely interested in security and peace in Europe and in the search for appropriate ways and means to normalize the situation in that continent  to deliver it from the hegemony of the two major imperialist Powers and to reject the idea of spheres of influence  to eliminate the two aggressive blocs dominated by them  and to create favorable circumstances for the development of European cooperation on the basis of respect for independence and national sovereignty  sovereign equality and mutual benefit  That is fully in line with the principles underlying our foreign policy  But  as all these States know full well  such noble objectives have nothing in common with the criminal plans of the United States and Soviet imperialists and their supporters  In all their activities  in all the pacts which they propose to conclude  in all their initiatives or proposals  including those on  European security    collective security in Asia   or  international security  presented once again  on the initiative of the Soviet revisionists  to the present session of the General Assembly the two Powers are constantly motivated by their insatiable greed to dominate and exploit the peoples of the world  by their desire to maintain and consolidate their spheres of influence in Europe and elsewhere and to have a free hand in those areas  to ensure tranquility to their rear the better to carry out all their various expansionist plans in Asia  Africa and elsewhere  using whatever means are necessary  even to the extent of threatening or using armed force    There is really no need to prove that this is the true state of affairs  It is amply borne out by all international realities and by the hotbeds of imperialist war in many areas of the world aggression in IndoChina  the Middle East  the Far East  Europe and elsewhere  the military bases of the United States and Soviet imperialists in Europe and other continents  their occupation of foreign territories  nuclear blackmail  the arms race  their fleets of warships v hich cruise in the Mediterranean  the Pacific and other seas and oceans and threaten peaceloving peoples and countries in those areas  It is all borne out  inter alia  by their criminal plans in Europe  where a particular role is assigned by them to revengeseeking Germany  their plans for Asia aimed particularly at the encirclement of the People s Republic of China and at preparation for war against that country with the cooperation of other aggressive Powers  in particular Japanese militarism  How can one claim to guarantee peace in Europe in such conditions under the aegis and protection of the two imperialist Powers  American and Soviet    One wonders against whom peace has to be guaranteed  Who is threatening the peace and security of the peoples of Europe  Can it be those of us from small  peaceloving countries  In our opinion  to be caught in such SovietAmerican traps as  European security  or  collective security in Asia  is tantamount to serving their aggressive plans or  rather  to throwing oneself to the wolves  Today more than ever before peace is indivisible  and we cannot have peace in Europe and war in Asia and elsewhere    Comrade Enver Hoxha  in his statement on the occasion of the twentyfifth anniversary of the liberation of Albania  stated in this connexion   First  the question is who should be assured and by whom  The  European security  which is sought by the Soviet revisionists and supported by the United States imperialists means security for their spheres of influence in Europe  security for their military bases and the right for their squadrons to patrol European coasts  This means that the peoples of Europe must legally and officially recognize the right of Moscow and Washington to conserve the special privileges of an imperialist and colonialist nature which they have in various countries of Europe  Such security boils down to the permanent maintenance in Europe of the status quo of Soviet American domination  to having calm ensured on that continent so that the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists have some freedom of movement and act freely in Asia  Africa and everywhere else in order to subjugate and enslave peoples  to reinforce their capitalistic system of exploitation  both at home and in their empires     We believe that international peace and security can be assured only by a resolute opposition and struggle against the two imperialist Powers  against their policy of diktat  aggression and war  Any other way would only be grist to the mill of those two Powers  which envisage the enslavement of Europe and the world    We are convinced that no matter what efforts are made by the American and Soviet imperialists and their collaborators  they will never have the tranquility they seek in Europe  They will run more and more into their own contradictions  and the peoples of Europe will not accept their hegemony in any guise  They will never allow them to pit Europe against Asia  and they will never allow themselves to be cannon fodder for the realization of the criminal plans of the two Powers    We are well aware that peaceloving Member States condemn the aggressive policies of the two imperialist Powers  their collusion at the expense of the cause of peaceloving peoples and countries  their monstrous plans to redivide and dominate the world  We have constantly admired the courageous and just struggle being waged by many countries  here in the United Nations and outside it  against this grand conspiracy of the two Powers  But the present international situation requires of all Member States faithful to the principles of the independence and equality of States great and small and respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity that they intensify their struggle still further and unite their efforts against AmericanSoviet imperialism and collusion and their desire to impose their diktat here  That is in the higher interests of international peace and security  which are seriously threatened by the aggressive policy of the American Soviet coalition  That is what is required for the lofty interests of the peoples who are fighting against imperialism  colonialism and reaction    Many States have fought unceasingly to do away with the unprecedented anomaly which exists in this Organization as a result of the violation of the lawful rights of the People s Republic of China and the usurpation of its place here by a clique of renegades in the service of American imperialism  Nevertheless  that scandalous and intolerable situation continues today because of the hostile and aggressive policy of the United States against great socialist China and its manipulation of the United Nations    At this session Albania and fourteen other countries have once again place on the Assembly s agenda the question of restoring the lawful rights of the Peoples s Republic of China in the United Nations   We have done so not only because there is a flagrant and gross violation of the Charter  which affects the sovereign rights of a founding Member State of the United Nations and permanent member of the Security Council  but also because the elimination of this abnormal  unprecedented situation is an urgent necessity for the United Nations if it is desired to take steps towards its recovery and to put it in a position to accomplish its tasks under the Charter  It is quite clear that without the People s Republic of China  given its authority  its great international role and its tremendous potential  this Organization cannot be in a position to make an effective contribution to the settlement of the important problems of our time    The People s Republic of China is a great and powerful socialist State that has had tremendous success in all areas and enjoys incomparable international prestige and authority  The dazzling victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution which thwarted the plots of the imperialists and revisionists and took control inside the Chinese citadel is a living testimony of the invincible force of the great Chinese people and guaranteed the great role which powerful socialist China now undeniably plays in the destinies of the peoples of the world    The People s Republic of China has become today a great and impregnable fortress in the liberation struggle of the peoples against imperialism  colonialism and reaction  It is the unshakable rampart of all progressive mankind    We consider that the position taken by the General Assembly on this question will prove its determination both to reject the diktat which the two great imperialist Powers seek lo exercise in the United Nations and to embark on a course in conformity with the aspirations of the peoples and the fundamental provisions of the Charter  We express the hope that the Governments of peaceloving States which constitute the xnajority here  aware of the serious situation in the United Nations  will have the courage to adopt the attitudes dictated by their convictions and the true interests of their countries and of the Organization itself    The People s Republic of Albania has constantly pursued an independent revolutionary foreign policy in accordance with the higher interests of the building and defense of our socialist homeland as well as those of the great cause of the peoples who are fighting for their freedom  their independence and their sacred right freely to determine their own future    The Albanian people have been able to defend their socialist homeland in every circumstance against all plots  threats and provocations of imperialists and revisionists  It is ever watchful and prepared at any moment to respond to anyone who dares to raise a hand against it     The Albanian people  its party and its Government  have supported and will continue strongly to support the legitimate struggle of peaceloving peoples and countries against the aggressive policy of the two imperialist Powers  their colonialist collaborators and their lackeys of all kinds  We have always stood by and shall always stand by the brother peoples of VietNam  Laos  Cambodia and the other peoples of IndoChina and Asia in their heroic struggle against the American aggressors and their allies of all kinds  We have supported and we shall continue unreservedly to support the legitimate fight of the fraternal Arab peoples against the Zionist aggressors and American and Soviet imperialists  who are mainly responsible for the present situation in the Middle East  We have vigorously supported the struggle of the peoples of European countries the peoples of Czechoslovakia  the German Democratic Republic and the other peoples of that continent as well as the peoples of other continents against the policy of domination  oppression and exploitation of the two imperialist Powers and against their counterrevolutionary  holy alliance     We are firmly convinced that the peoples of the entire world  who are fighting for a just cause on the vast antiimperialist and anticolonialist front  in ever more resolute combat solidarity  will put down all plots  aggressive plans and aggressions  no matter who may be responsible for them  and will win their final victory over their common enemies    The delegation of the People s Republic of Albania  at this session of the General Assembly  guided by the MarxistLeninist principles of our Socialist State  will continue  as in the past  together with other freedomloving peoples to make its modest contribution to the cause of freedom  independence and genuine cooperation in friendship among all the people of th  world   \n",
       "1     It is a fortunate coincidence that precisely at a time when the United Nations is celebrating its first twentyfive years of existence  an eminent jurist so closely linked to our Organization should have been elected to preside over the General Assembly  On behalf of the Argentine Government  it is a pleasure for me to congratulate Your Excellency  Mr  President  on this felicitous choice    Through you I should also like to express the appreciation of the Argentine delegation to Mrs  Angie BrooksRandolph of Liberia  for the work she performed as President of the twentyfourth session    From this rostrum  the Argentine Government wishes to express to the delegation of the United Arab Republic its regret and sympathy upon the recent death of His Excellency President Gamal Abdel Nasser  The loss of this outstanding statesman has not only plunged the Arab world into mourning  but has also deeply grieved all those who greatly valued his capacity to contribute actively to the establishment of peace in the Middle East    When the Organization of the United Nations was created in   its founders had two fundamental purposes in mind  on the one hand  solemnly to formulate the basic principles of the international system and  on the other  to establish a legal framework in keeping with the political and social needs of the immediate postwar era  Both objectives were the result of the historical experience of mankind and of the interests and aspirations which all civilized nations can in no way renounce  The enunciation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations was thus considered as a sign of moral evolution and maturity of peoples    The need to rely upon a stable management of international relations is also deeply rooted in the history of nations  In the course of time  a number of philosophical and legalpolitical currents proposed guiding principles that went beyond State limits  Up to the beginning of the twentieth century  for more or less lengthy periods  international peace had been ensured by means of treaties signed among the great Powers  These laid the groundwork for peace and de facto established conditions for international stability  The socalled  European concert  is good proof of this concept which restricted the active access of the nonEuropean states to international life    The growing democratization of the international society and the part played in the solution of controversies by the small countries contributed to the crumbling of that restricted concept of the system and to laying the foundations for a legalpolitical structure of worldwide scope resting upon the consent and equality of States based on a distribution of responsibilities  This was precisely what the League of Nations sought to accomplish  The catastrophe of the Second World War is the clearest proof of the way in which that organization had to yield to the trends that finally proved it incapable of maintaining peace among States    However  the need for an international normative system was summed up in a number of international instruments and conferences  from the Atlantic Charter in  to Dumbarton Oaks in   It was the San Francisco Conference  however  which was ultimately to adopt the Charter of the United Nations  thus taking those historic aspirations up again and embarking upon a new era in the management of international affairs    It might justifiably have been felt at that time that  when the United Nations linked the ideals of peace and security with the existence of adequate legal machinery that it had thereby ensured international stability and harmony among nations    Today it is not difficult to prove that  although the principles may still be valid  the actual force of many of them is relative  Future historians of this quartercentury will no doubt use as a guiding thread the listings of constant violations of those principles in almost all areas of the world  They will also be able to show the lack of efficiency of many measures  the existence of which seemed to end at the time of their adoption    There is a notorious maladjustment between institution and reality  We are not referring here to the discrepancy that may exist between what should be and what factually is  We know that ideals always precede their practical fulfillment  History has shown to what extent ideas that at one time were deemed Utopian gradually became specific and indispensable factors of our everyday life    The discrepancy between the normative framework and reality to which we refer here is of a different nature  We have drawn away from the empiric possibilities that existed  and we sometimes tend to forget that our Organization is supported by the political will of the Member States  Proclaiming principles does not in itself make them realities  and it is not sufficient to multiply the legal machinery when the latter is not based upon the social reality it is intended to regulate    Furthermore  if we are fully aware of the difficulties that our Organization faces in settling important questions bearing on international peace and security  it is difficult to understand how year after year we are willing to allow the agenda of the United Nations to be swollen by secondary items which consume so much time and money and are doomed to remain without solution  The bureaucratic and budgetary growth of our Organization and the useless waste of effort are unavoidable consequences of such an attitude    Mention has been made of the need to revise the Charter  Theoretically speaking we cannot but support such a measure  but from the practical point of view we are fully aware of the almost insuperable problems that such a step implies  Perhaps it might be more worthwhile to make an effort to try to use to the utmost those resources provided for and authorized by the Charter  instead of undertaking a scarcely possible revision  particularly with regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes  If  furthermore  we wish to act with a practical awareness  we must bear in mind that some of the measures approved by this General Assembly or by the Security Council require adequate financial resources for full implementation  Very often extremely serious functional maladjustments are due to the fact that this elementary circumstance has been overlooked    The United Nations will be what its Member States wish it to be  What is most serious is that as we pare down our active participation or neglect the consideration of our possibilities it becomes more difficult to put into practice the Purposes and Principles of the Charter  thus endangering international peace and security    The skepticism and discouragement with which many of our contemporaries gauge the actions of the United Nations are understandable  We  as representatives of the States Members of the Organization  have the duty to be honest with ourselves and to adopt a critical stand that will permit us to judge both our successes and our failures objectively    In order to carry out such an analysis  we might establish a threefold division of problems  First of all  there are those that have been practically or entirely settled  and in this case our satisfaction at what has been accomplished is justified  Secondly  there are those problems that have acquired a chronic degree of gravity and have been awaiting solution for years  In this case discouragement is well founded  and it is urgent that we adopt effective measures to correct the structural and operational flaws in our Organization  Thirdly  there are the new problems created by the emergence of facts that have changed the world situation  In this last case we should act with sufficient determination so that these matters will become part of the first of this series and not swell the ranks of the second group    Decolonization belongs in the first group of problems  This has surely been one of the outstanding phenomena of our day  New States in full enjoyment of their sovereignty  have become active participants in the international system  The principle of the self determination of peoples has thus found its true application  and its observance has helped to enrich the international political situation  Resolution   XV   the tenth anniversary of which we shall soon be marking  served to hasten the windingup process of the colonialist regimes and to ensure a greater equality  at least in the political field  among the peoples of the world  The Argentine Republic is firmly convinced that decolonization must be totally carried out    For that reason we continue to be concerned over the situation of the Territories of southern Africa which still remain under colonial administration  Within this context  the atmosphere is further troubled by the existence of a Government which illegally holds power in Southern Rhodesia  by the racial discrimination that is represented by apartheid and by the non recognition of the authority of the United Nations of which we are witnesses in Namibia    In this context I wish to refer to a matter of vital importance to the Argentine Republic  the question of the Malvinas Islands  True to its diplomatic traditions  my Government agreed to negotiate with the United Kingdom regarding the dispute over the sovereignty of the islands  In so doing  we were interpreting the spirit and the letter of resolution   XX  and  at the same time  we declared our irrevocable decision shared by all the people of Argentina to have the Malvinas Islands restored to our territorial  heritage  Since the end of the last session of this General Assembly negotiations have continued on the diplomatic level  It was with great interest that we pursued the talks regarding the problem of communications between the Islands and the Argentine mainland  for we believe that these are the first steps towards the solution of the dispute  In due course  we shall report on the results of these talks    Those whose votes have made it possible for Argentina and the United Kingdom to begin their talks with a view to ending a situation which is incompatible with the terms of resolution   XV  did so because they considered that decolonization is an irreversible process that brooks no exceptions  There can  furthermore  be no doubt that the question of the Malvinas Islands is an obstacle to the development of the ties that should link Argentina with the United Kingdom increasingly closely  Therefore  the solution to this problem cannot be unduly delayed  My Government reaffirms is right to raise the matter again in this Assembly if the talks fail or if they are excessively prolonged    We believe it urgent that these cases should be solved so that they will not remain to swell the number of problems in the second of the groups I have mentioned  that is  the problems pending solution    The question of general and complete disarmament also belongs in this category  If we consider the consequences of the qualitative development of the new systems of weaponry on the life of international society  it is difficult to presume that the efforts to achieve an easing of political tension within the system can possibly show lasting results while the arsenals of the great Powers remain at their present levels or are increased    For this reason my Government attaches considerable importance to the strategic arms limitation talks which are taking place bilaterally between the United States and the Soviet Union  but we feel it necessary to recall the fact that urgent measures should be adopted for nuclear disarmament within the context of general and complete disarmament under effective international control    Argentina continues to participate actively in the deliberations of the Conference of the Committee  on disarmament convinced as it is of the vital importance of seeking ari understanding that might help to dissipate the threat of a nuclear catastrophe    That Conference has submitted to this present session a draft treaty prohibiting the emplacement of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and ocean floors and on the subsoil thereof   The document on which we are now to take a stand contains significant changes compared to the one that was considered at the twentyfourth session of the General Assembly  Some of these tend to protect the legitimate interests of the coastal States and at the same time prevent those provisions covering verification from prejudging matters touching upon the law of the sea  Argentina attaches special relevance to all of these principles  as is attested to by our active participation in the amendment of the previous draft  The text  such as it has been presented to the General Assembly  has our support and we hope that it will be approved by a widespread majority of Member States    The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has continued the examination of the question of chemical and bacteriological  biological  weapons on the basis of the two draft conventions and other proposals which were submitted to it  The Committee has dedicated itself to the treatment of both types of armaments and has seriously considered the political and technical aspects pertaining to the subject  My Government attaches special significance to the problem of verification procedures which it might be necessary to adopt  It is to be hoped that the General Assembly will recommend that the Committee should continue this task which  although difficult  is nevertheless most necessary    With regard to the elaboration of a detailed program on general and complete disarmament  the report submitted by the Committee shows that this matter was one of its main concerns  We deem it advisable to reiterate that the aim of the program must be the achieving of general and complete disarmament under effective international control  On various occasions we had already warned about the negative consequences of collateral measures which  because of their discriminatory character  actually constitute the  disarmament of the unarmed  and do not signify a true contribution to the achievement of a true general armaments reduction    There can be no doubt that the conflict in the Middle East is one of the typical cases that has not as yet found a settlement within the framework of the United Nations  It is to be hoped that the encouraging symptoms noticed lately will help to allay the suspicions that have been felt by both parties  Thus the first steps may then be taken towards the effective implementation of resolution     of the Security Council  in the drafting of which Argentina played a significant part  We believe that this resolution points to the right road to peace  Furthermore  my Government reaffirms its faith in the Jarring mission as a means towards understanding and  through the participation of Argentine officers  will continue to cooperate in the supervision of the ceasefire in the Suez Canal area    SouthEast Asia is also a source of serious concern  That grave problem can be settled only if negotiations among those directly involved are pursued in a spirit in keeping with the Charter  The continuous delays which hinder the elimination of this permanent breach of the peace are contrary to the purposes of the United Nations    We cannot in this context overlook the constant danger being run by those who  in their capacity as news correspondents  are present in the zone of conflict in order to carry out their difficult task of keeping world public opinion informed of the battles more efficiently and accurately  Respect for human rights during armed conflicts requires special observance in the case of news correspondents during hostilities  My own country is prepared to consider measures to guarantee greater security to those engaged in this important work    Both the situation in the Middle East and that of SouthEast Asia are of concern to the community of nations not only because of the constant losses in human lives  but also because  despite their apparently regional nature  they may endanger the security of the entire system  We know full well that the interests at stake in this case go beyond th  direct participants in the struggle  Reference to these cases is necessary in a statement made before this Assembly  The trouble with periodic repetitions is that the problems we are analyzing tend to become Commonplace  Nothing could be more grave and serious than to accustom ourselves to living with war and destruction and to think that both are inevitable at a given time in history  Our insistence therefore in referring to these conflicts must not be interpreted as a repetition of just another rhetorical sentence  but as the proof of a deeply felt concern    Among the third group of problems mentioned  that is  those that have emerged recently  must be listed a question that warrants special attention because it seriously bears upon international peace and security  I refer to the committing of acts of violence and terrorism that constitute true crimes in terms of international criminal law  Violence and subversion  especially in Latin America  have acquired such a scope and magnitude in certain cases as to affect the very basis of international order  If we truly wish to practice tolerance as a fundamental attribute of democracy in our continent  we cannot permit indiscriminate violence  alleging pretexts of confused political ideals in order to convert crimes offensive to human conscience into instruments of social transformation  The Argentine people categorically rejects the committing of those crimes  which are completely alien to its way of life and to the philosophy of freedom which supports it    In the Organization of American States the Republic of Argentina has pointed out the need to define and then to prevent and to punish this type of crime  The Argentine Government understands that it js incumbent upon each State to adopt those measures it deems necessary to repress acts that violate order and security within its own territory  Yet the knowledge that in many cases terrorists and kidnappers receive some kind of foreign assistance in the form of money  weapons or training forces us to consider the need to encourage concerted action on a worldwide scale so that those individuals will not escape justice  Within the regional framework  the InterAmerican Juridical Committee four days ago  on  September  approved a draft convention on terrorism and kidnapping of persons with a view to extortion  which will be submitted for the consideration of members of the Organization of American States  It should be pointed out that article  of that draft provides that the Convention will remain open  for signature by the member States of the Organization of American States  as well as any other State Member of the United Nations or any other State invited to do so by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States     The increasing frequency of acts of hijacking deserves unanimous condemnation by all States Members of the Organization  Argentina considers that the United Nations should adopt adequate measures to prevent recurrence of this crime    I wish now to refer to one of the subjects of greatest significance on the agenda of this twentyfifth session of the General Assembly  namely  the Second United Nations Development Decade and the plan for a global strategy which we are to set in motion during the commemorative period of the present session  Lengthy has been the road covered in the last few years in order to put into practice the principles of the Charter in matters of international cooperation for economic and social progress of all peoples  A clear example of this is what took place during the decade of the s when  for the first time  an effort was made to establish equal opportunities for countries at different levels of development  through a systematization of efforts to achieve specific growth objectives  During those years the aspirations of the developing countries were clearly seen and intense multilateral activity took place    In the various United Nations specialized agencies  in the Economic and Social Council and in the General Assembly  we have in the last few years succeeded in identifying the elements on which to base national efforts and international cooperation  Those elements have been embodied in a considerable number of documents on global and sectoral objectives for economic and social development  With regard to these objectives  there exists an almost unanimous agreement on the part of the different sectors  or at least a sound and honest will to reach a compromise    The study of the final form the agreements on political measures for tne fulfillment of those objectives should have is at present in the last stage of negotiation  and it is a promising sign that those talks are not on the substance of the problem but only on a timetable for implementation  This fact alone renders obvious the spirit in which the international community is entering the decade of the seventies  a decade which will be called upon to put into practice agreed measures for the achievement of the objectives of development    In the implementation of those measures an equal share of responsibility will be borne by both the developed and the developing countries  It is a matter of uniting efforts and of adding to the solidarity of the more industrialized nations  as well as the determination of the other countries to make serious and continuous progress along the road of their own development  Sterile confrontations or the complacency of the recipients of aid can only delay solutions and benefit those who thrive on inertia  For this reason we believe in conciliating interests  Our strategy must consist in promoting a range of positive solutions which  by gradually including new measures or widening the scope of already adopted instruments  will raise to an increasingly high and efficient level economic cooperation among all Members of the Organization  Only thus will we reach the targets set for the Second United Nations Development Decade    One of the factors that has had the greatest impact on the history of the last twentyfive years has been the astounding progress of science and technology  Ours has been called the era of the scientific civilization  That description is not an arbitrary one  Never before has the destiny of mankind depended so much on the rational conquest of nature  Never before have discoveries in the field of science and their immediate application through technology so substantially altered human and interState relations  Those countries which lack adequate means in order to utilize science and technology fully will be left outside the flow of history  The intellectual power has today become the fourth sector of the economy  The advanced communities are in fact  study societies     The Argentine Republic is ready to intensify further the policy of achieving agreements with other States for cooperation and mutual assistance in the field of science and technology  Within the United Nations we shall support as we do in the Organization of American States any proposals designed to encourage basic research and the transfer of applied technology  We believe that if this transfer is not carried out and if international sharing of the burdens of research is not increased  all other efforts made to bridge the gaps between countries at different levels of development will be in vain    We firmly believe that multilateral cooperation  such as that carried out in the specialized agencies and bodies  particularly in the United Nations Development program  is a proof of what the United Nations can achieve when there is apolitical will of commitment in the field of assistance    When modern science and technology became a decisive factor in international life  new fields were opened up for the legal regulation or settlement of relations among States  One of these was that of the seabed and ocean floor  Argentina considers that the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction should be considered the common heritage of mankind  It is unfortunate that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the SeaBed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction has not yet reached an agreement on a declaration of principles to be submitted to the General Assembly  in accordance with the terms of resolution  B  XXIV   The Republic of Argentina believes that the Declaration of principles should reflect the necessary adaptation of the law to the changes that occur in international life    Once the Committee has drafted the regime applicable to the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  the time will have come for the convening of a comprehensive conference on the law of the sea  That conference will have  to deal with all those aspects that may require revision or establishment due to the appearance of interests or situations calling for new international legal regulation  Thus  the criteria set forth by the General Assembly in resolution  B  XXIV  will be complied with    Argentina wishes to express its satisfaction at the work done by the Special Committee on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States  My country has had the honor of participating in the work of the Special Committee since its creation in  and has endeavored at all times to make a most constructive contribution to its deliberations  We consider that the draft declaration that has finally been prepared is a valuable document for the codification and progressive development of fundamental principles of international law and we are ready to give it our full support when it is considered by the General Assembly    When the Charter of the United Nations was signed in the city of San Francisco twentyfive years ago  precisely  years had elapsed since publication of a short essay of prophetic intuition  In his native city of Konigsberg  Emmanuel Kant  in   published his  Essay on perpetual peace   In it he attempted to show that universal peace was not only desirable and conceivable  but necessary and inevitable  In order to achieve it  there had to exist an international order based on a law consented to by all nations  Thus    each State  even the smallest  could expect respect for its security and its rights  not through its own power or its own definition of the law  but simply as the result of the existence of a great society of nations  all abiding by laws adopted through their united will     The important fact in our day is that this united will for peace  considered as an indivisible entity  should be universal in scope  Perhaps the very stability of our international system as a conditioning factor requires that we do not set aside the undeniable factual realities of the world of today  If this be the case  then we have the right to wonder how this concern can be rendered compatible with a restricted universalization of the United Nations    In the course of this statement we have mentioned a series of facts that are of concern to us as they affect peace or hamper the effective achievement of international cooperation  I do not believe it difficult to agree with this analysis  But this would not be complete without mentioning  as one of the undeniable achievements of the Organization  the fact that it has localized and solved some of the conflicts that might have had serious effects on international peace and security  The United Nations has effectively contributed to keeping alive our awareness of the danger to all mankind of a generalized conflict  It is this very awareness which leads us to view with interest the signing of the recent Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the USSR which will contribute to detente in Europe    A hundred years ago  a great Argentine thinker  Juan Bautista Alberdi  wrote that   War is the justice every one works out for himself failing world justice  World justice is lacking because the world is deprived of unity and does not as yet constitute an international society  Therefore  the way to abolish war is to help the consolidation of the world into a State of States  a society of societies  a nation of nations  as a type of entity to work out a justice that  today  everyone works out for himself  by means of war     In   we now have this  nation of nations   If justice is to be imposed by the threat or use of force  and if man  in all areas  has not yet achieved the dignity he deserves  the future will hold us responsible    The  Argentine Republic  within the framework of its international commitments  will maintain the principle of freedom of action of its foreign policy in an ever increasingly interdependent world and pledges all its efforts to fulfill the desire for peace and cooperation which twentyfive years ago was embodied in the Charter of the United Nations

       "2     It is a pleasure for me to extend to you  Mr  President  the warmest congratulations of the Australia Government and its delegation to this General Assembly on your election to the Presidency  The distinguished part you have played in the service of your country and in the development of this Organization  notably through your authoritative study of the Charter  makes you a fitting and admirable choice to preside over this session    In congratulating you I also want to express through you the thanks and appreciation of the Australian delegation for the efficient and dedicated manner in which your predecessor  Mrs  Angie Brooks Randolph of Liberia  discharged her responsibilities as President of the twentyfourth session    As so many of my colleagues have said  this twentyfifth anniversary session is an appropriate occasion to examine the workings of our Organization its successes and failures  its merits and shortcomings    looking back to  we should keep in mind the a     nations of the founder Members of the United Nations in San Francisco and the problems they had to solve    Today  under the compulsion of circumstances and events  we must ask ourselves  o what extent the United Nations has succeeded  I  paramount and immediate importance  we must ask whether we can make any contribution to improving its performance  This  I emphasize  is the greatest test of statesmanship and sincerity of our times    Let us recall the conditions that existed when the Charter was signed  It was an unhappy and disturbed world in which the most destructive war of all times was still being fought  a war in which my country and many others  large and small  were still heavily involved  a war wnidi had directly or indirectly dominated people s daily lives everywhere throughout six years of struggle against violent and tyrannical oppression  It was a more disturbed world than that which had given birth a generation earlier to the League of Nations  It was a world in which there was a passionate yearning for peace and order  for a system of rules for the orderly conduct of relations between nations  for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for the improvement of the quality of life for all mankind    In this mood of hope and determination our Governments met in San Francisco  There was never much disagreement about the name to be given to the new Organization  the worldwide alliance of Powers  then within sight of final victory   had already become known as the United Nations    The forging of its Charter  on the other hand  was necessarily a more difficult process  After the traumatic experience of the Second World War the nations united in war were ready enough to recognize the need for a more broadly based and more effective institution than the League of Nations  a new institution which would have to accommodate the aspirations and interests of more than fifty nations  The major Powers had differences to reconcile amongst themselves and the rights of the smaller nations were vigorously pressed  not least of all by the Australian delegation  Thus the Charter that emerged was inevitably the product of compromise  implicit as well as explicit  This should be recognized in any evaluation of the past    The Charter was founded on the proposition that the major allied Powers  those which carried the heaviest burden of the war  would share the main responsibility for preserving the peace  If this concept was to be successful it had to be postulated on the continued existence among the major allies of the same unity of purpose that had carried them to the point of victory and on a common interest in maintaining world peace in  he future  It was with that expectation  indeed on t edition  that the major allies were given a special position under the Charter  with rights and obligations exceeding those of all other Members    Even before the Charter was signed  suspicion and discord had arisen amongst them  Succeeding years have seen an intensified conflict of ideologies and worldwide clashes of national interests  At times it even seemed that the objective was conflict and turmoil and not peace and security  and the promotion  rather than the suppression  of armed conflict in areas of competitive interest  Those differences of outlook  interests and ideology among the permanent members of the Security Council have prevented the Council from performing the role intended for it by the Charter    We cm speculate about what might have happened if the Military Staff Committee  so hopefully envisaged under Chapter VII of the Charter  had been allowed to take shape and to assume the functions planned for it    We might also deplore our failure to settle the question of how the costs of peacekeeping operations are to be shared equitably    Having said that  we should acknowledge that we have been spared the horrors of a third world war  Undoubtedly  the basic explanation up to the present has been the rapid development of weapon technology  Another world war has been too horrible for any nation to contemplate  No one could win  The world as a whole would be certain to suffer disastrous consequences    The United Nations may perhaps claim some small credit for providing a safety valve for public debate and a forum in which the great Powers have been forced to explain and justify their attitudes and actions  In its twentyfive years the United Nations has not been able to prevent a number of limited wars of the conventional type  nor has it found the answer to insidious threats to national integrity and security through the newly developed techniques of infiltration  subversion and insurgency    The peacekeeping record has not  however  been wholly bleak  Korea is an illustration  even without agreement among the major Powers  In the Middle East  Kashmir  the Congo and Cyprus  United Nations forces and truce supervisory teams have in the past played a significant role in critical situations which could have grown considerably worse without their presence    Despite strains  divisions and its limited record of achievement in its primary role  th  United Nations has survived for twentyfive years  That indicates that many Members recognize that there is a residual or net value in the Organization and that they still hope for a future in which it will perform functions which measure up to their expectations    As we look to the future  it is surely no exaggeration to say that the reputation of the United Nations and the degree of respect it enjoys among people everywhere will hinge on its performance in helping to settle disputes among nations and in keeping the peace    Undoubtedly  there is room for improvement in the peacekeeping procedures of the Organization and the machinery provided for the settlement of disputes  But practical success in this peacekeeping role must depend ultimately on subjective factors the attitudes  intentions and honesty of purpose of the great Powers and of the individual nations concerned in particular disputes    Australia has consistently supported the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations with both men and money  As early as  we were one of the three members of one of the first mediation and peacekeeping missions set up by the United Nations the United Nations Commission for Indonesia  We contributed substantial forces to the United Nations action in Korea    At the present time we are making a significant contribution to peace observation and supervision in Kashmir  the Middle East and Cyprus  We will continue  as a member of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations  to support efforts to formulate procedures designed to increase the effectiveness of future operations and to ensure that they are properly financed  We will continue to maintain our firm belief in the United Nations Charter and are convinced that in the faithful and devoted support of its principles lies the best hope for the future peace and progress of mankind    From peacekeeping and the peaceful settlement of disputes  let me turn to the painful and difficult problem of arms control and the reduction of armaments  The constant and frightening improvement in military technology and the complexity of the problems involved in effecting balanced armament reductions make the subject of disarmament a difficult one for most to understand  This difficulty of understanding is  no excuse for thinking it is an academic exercise divorced from the realities of daily living    All of us know that the continuing discussions and negotiations on the control and reduction of armaments  protracted  complex and technical as they are  can vitally affect the security of all countries  Security may be indivisible  but dangers to security vary in nature and degree from region to region and from country to country    The advent of the nuclear balance of terror and the knowledge of other equally horrifying weapons of mass destruction have brought home to us forcibly how vulnerable we are to the whims of scientific progress in the notoriously accidentprone hands of mankind  Surely it is right that our efforts to control armaments should concentrate in the first instance on limiting and controlling weapons of mass destruction    That said  it should be added that a worldwide balance of force  if it is to be effective in containing aggression and preserving security  must include the balance of conventional as well as nuclear armaments  It is with conventional weapons that the many acts of aggression have been committed in the years since the Charter came into force  and we must unhappily expect that there will be more  To pay less attention to the threat that is familiar and traditional than to the threat that is almost unimaginable but controllable is contrary to our mutual interests and welfare    I believe we can be a little encouraged by the progress that has been made in arms control and disarmament  First  Australia has signed the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons subject to certain understandings and interpretations  We hope it will in time become a fully effective barrier against the proliferation of nuclear weapons  Secondly  indications of progress in the strategic arms limitation talks between the United States and the Soviet Union also offer some hope  Thirdly  the prospect of agreement to prevent the placing of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed is also welcome  The Australian Government hopes that the text of the draft treaty now before the Assembly will gain widespread support  Fourthly  there are also grounds for hope that  as a result of discussion at the conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva this year  we may be at or near the threshold of substantive progress towards supplementing and strengthening the prohibitions on chemical and biological weapons of war that already exist in the Geneva Protocol of     I have spoken at length about the influences that affect the balance between peace and war because the paramount purpose of the United Nations must still be to preserve peace and outlaw war and because this paramount purpose has not always been well served    Let me turn now to another purpose of the Charter which can be measured by the increase in membership of the United Nations in twentyfive years  I refer to the progress from dependent status to full sovereignty and statehood of more than half of the present Members of the Organization    The circumstances in which those sections of the Charter relating to dependent Territories came to be drafted in San Francisco are worth remembering  The Covenant of the League of Nations broke new ground  It introduced and put into effect in the Mandate system the novel concept that the international community held a degree of responsibility for the guidance of colonial peoples towards selfgovernment and independence  By  that concept had been strengthened and developed by the experiences of the Second World War  selfdetermination for dependent Territories became the accepted goal  and was given wider and more precise expression in Chapters XI  XII and XIII of the Charter    I note here that the Australian delegation at San Francisco took a particularly active part in the drafting of those Chapters  especially those sections dealing with the rights of the peoples of dependent Territories and the obligations of the administering Powers and of the United Nations towards them    Since that time there have been profound and rapid changes  which are continuing  The Charter set the targets and the standards  It only remained for the metropolitan Powers to accept responsibility for the changes that inevitably had to be made  In most cases they were accepted willingly and generously    There was also a complementary responsibility for the dependent peoples themselves first to understand their opportunities and responsibilities and then work towards achieving them  In some cases freedom and national sovereignty came only after a lengthy and sometimes bitter struggle  in most cases they came more happily as a result of a rational acceptance of the situation by both sides and a peaceful and mutually satisfactory transfer of political power    In this process of the development of dependent peoples to nationhood the United Nations  reflecting the liberal and humanitarian instincts of mankind  and sometimes its impatience  has played a significant part    To be specific  I want to speak briefly about one dependent area of great concern to Australia  in which this process of developing is taking place rapidly  This is the Territory of Papua and New Guinea    Let me describe the position there  It is the largest of the remaining dependent Territories outside the continent of Africa  it lies immediately to the north of Australia  its area is approximately   square miles  and its population totals two and a quarter million  It is a larger unit than many Members of the United Nations  Because of its exceptionally rugged terrain and the successive waves of migration that occurred over the centuries  these two and a quarter million people are divided amongst themselves by ethnic and tribal differences and also by something like  different languages not different dialects  but different languages  It is this fragmented society that is now drawing together into an identifiable nation    My delegation reports each year to this Assembly about the progress made and the difficulties encountered during the preceding twelve months  The proclaimed policy is to ensure the exercise by the people of the Territory of their inalienable right to self determination  We are now doing  and will continue to do  all we can to prepare the people of the Territory for the termination of dependent status and their accession to full selfgovernment and independence    Next year another United Nations Visiting Mission  the seventh  will go to the Territory and will be able to see for itself the striking progress that has been made since the visit of the last Mission in     Earlier this year I had the honor to lead the Australian delegation to the meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East  which recommended that the Territory of Papua and New Guinea be admitted as one of its associate members  a recommendation which has since been unanimously approved by the Economic and Social Council at its fortyninth session     The Australian Government thinks that this approval and other activities  such as participation in the South Pacific Conference  are recognition of the growing national identity of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and further steps along the road towards selfdetermination    I should like now to range northward and westward from New Guinea into Asia  Let me say that I presume to speak about the general situation throughout Asia because of the great importance to this Organization of events there and their particular importance to Australia    In our view  to judge from the agenda of this twentyfifth session  Asia receives less attention than it is entitled to from the General Assembly  I would like to think that this was a good sign  that a peaceful and wellordered Asia offered few serious problems to the international community  Up to a point this may be true  In the view of my Government it is fair to say that apart from the few serious and easily identifiable major problems  there is evidence throughout eastern  southeastern and southern Asia of a measure of stability  vitality and economic progress that we would not have dared to hope for twenty years ago    Of these major problems China is critical  We shall again be considering the question of the representation of China in the United Nations  Australia  situated at the edge of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to SouthEast Asia  is more concerned with its longterm relations with mainland China than most Members of this Organization  We see plenty of evidence to our north of how much the enormous size  power  and influence of mainland China intrude into and affect the interests and the calculations of smaller nations  My predecessors in office  when speaking to the Assembly  have emphasized that the problem of China s relations with its immediate neighbors and with the rest of the world outside Asia is much greater and more complex than the question of Communist China s admission to this Assembly    We see as clearly as anyone the need for an accommodation with the Peking regime  and we are as anxious as anyone that an accommodation be achieved  But we constantly run up against the mirror image  in its conduct of its external relations  of the ruthlessness and harshness which have been a feature of the present regime s treatment of its own people  Above all  we are conscious of the need for a settlement of the future of the people of Taiwan that takes full account of the wishes of  million people  more than the population of Australia and oft the majority of Member countries of the United Nations  The interests and welfare of  million people are not to be treated as an incidental consideration in some package deal  The Assembly has a grave responsibility to ensure that the status and the rights of these people are protected and guaranteed    It is sometimes claimed that the admission of Communist China to the United Nations will act as a catalyst in opening the way to better relations between China and that part of the international community from which Peking seems to have chosen to isolate itself  We do not at present share this optimistic view  On the other hand  we suppose that the adoption by Communist China of a more reasonable attitude towards international society as a whole  and towards the purposes and principles of the Charter  would facilitate its entry into this Organization    I turn next to the gravest problem now facing us in Asia  It is an unhappy reflection of the failure of the United Nations in its primary role of keeper of the peace that the VietNam situation has never been properly debated here  let alone considered as to possible action  Everywhere else  of course  the VietNam war has been for five years and more one of the great divisive issues of our time  It is understandable that the world s conscience should have revolted against the fearful losses and hardships that the people of VietNam have suffered almost without interruption since well before the United Nations came into being  It is less understandable  in the view of the Australian Government  that the people of South VietNam who are manifestly the victims of aggression in its most naked and ruthless form and the elected Government of South VietNam which has demonstrated beyond doubt that it reflects the wishes of the great majority of the people should have had to undergo so much biased and totally unfair criticism    The outrages they have been compelled to endure from their internal and external aggressors  acting in complete defiance of the Geneva Agreements of   need to be precisely stated  Intimidation  kidnapping  extortion and assassinations have the same meaning in anyone s language  whatever devices are employed to present them under the guise of  liberation     The day may come we all hope it will when the people of North and South VietNam can be reunited  In the meantime there is a wellmarked boundary between the north and the south  Both halves of VietNam could begin to achieve the economic stability and wellbeing of some of their neighbors if only the regime in Hanoi could be persuaded to give up its hopeless struggle and withdraw behind the demilitarized zone    The spillover of the VietNam conflict into neighboring Laos and Cambodia is well enough known to this Assembly  at least in general terms  The representatives of those countries will  I am sure  describe it in detail    Australia has been active throughout the past decade in helping the Government of Laos to maintain a stable economy and thereby to resist the familiar pressures and encroachments of an alien and unwanted ideology    More recently the same kinds of pressure have been brought to bear on Cambodia  There the North VietNamese aggression was a blatant violation of the country s neutrality and independence  In May of this year the Australian Government took part in a regional conference of Foreign Ministers held in Djakarta to consider this enlarged threat    That meeting of Foreign Ministers was a constructive initiative by the Asian countries most directly concerned to try to ensure respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and neutrality of Cambodia  The collective view of that meeting was subsequently communicated accurately and forcefully to the Secretary General  to the Governments of the major Powers and in a number of other capitals by three selected envoys from the group    I sincerely hope that the General Assembly will recognize this as a valuable regional initiative that is not only provided for but encouraged under Chapter VIII of the Charter    A great deal has been said  and more is bound to be said in the course of this Assembly  about the situation in the Middle East  Emotions are running high as a result of difficulties that have impeded the United States effort to restart peace talks and because of the recent series of criminal acts against civil aircraft and their passengers  The present situation is extremely delicate  In these circumstances I do not believe that any more detailed comments by me at this stage would be helpful    Let me turn to one other topic  In the last twenty five years the world has seen tremendous progress in the physical sciences and in industrial technology  These advances in science and technology will bring great benefits to mankind  They can also produce major side effects  often of a harmful kind    An international organization like this  concerned with the maintenance of peace and security and the promotion of international economic cooperation and the raising of living standards  must concern itself continuously with these developments  In our view  the United Nations has a significant and urgent responsibility to assist in the application of science and technology to national development in the most constructive and beneficial way  Conversely  we must do all in our power to minimize the harmful effects of technological change    The United Nations has a related responsibility  equally important  to devise an acceptable framework of international law in which the development of science and technology can proceed in those spheres beyond the conventional limits of national jurisdiction  At present the pace of such development is threatening to outstrip the capacity of international lawyers to devise such a framework    It is a matter of regret that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has not been able to negotiate a convention on liability for damage caused by space objects  Australia  with most other countries  has argued strongly in favor of a convention that would provide certain  prompt and equitable compensation for the victims of space damage  This remains an area in which technology is moving dangerously far ahead of the law    Advances in science and technology have also created a need for international legal action in regard to the seas and the seabed  The problems involved are urgent  comprising both the review of old concepts and the development of new ones  The substantive decisions that must be made will be important for Governments and their peoples and for the international community at large    Those who are responsible for taking these decisions must bear in mind that the system or systems they devise will have to deal equitably with differing and often competing national and international interests if they are to gain widespread acceptance  The alternative to coherent multilateral action with respect to the problems of the seas and the seabed could well be an unmanageable situation    Of all the consequences of the introduction and intensive application of new developments to science and technology none has given rise to wider concern than their effects upon the human environment  Our natural surroundings are being increasingly recognized as an irreplaceable part of our heritage  The problems of pollution have arisen in their starkest form in the highly industrialized countries  and it is to be hoped that those countries where pollution of the environment has not yet reached the same crisis point will be able to profit from the lessons learned elsewhere    Australia s own situation  where the noxious byproducts of industrial development are as much a subject for debate and action as the need to develop our natural resources  puts us in a particularly good position to share with all regions of the world the fruits of cur experience in coping with man s environment  As a basis on which a contribution can be made to help solve this problem the Australian Senate recently appointed a Select Committee to report on water pollution  The report has been completed and consideration is now being given to the most appropriate method of preventing further pollution    We do not need to be reminded that this year is not only the twentyfifth anniversary of this Organization but also the first year of the Second United Nations Development Decade  We in Australia understand how fervently the developing countries want the Second Development Decade to succeed  It is in this spirit that our representatives have participated in the various United Nations and other forums which have been discussing the preparations for the Second Development Decade over the past two years  and particularly the aid programs    Three weeks ago I made an extensive review before the Australian Parliament of our policies of assistance for the developing countries  I reaffirmed our position at last week s ministerial meeting in Tokyo of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development    We have long thought that the only valid test of a country s approach to development assistance is its performance and its deeply felt desire to be helpful  We believe that Australia s record of performance compares well with that of others  Our aid to developing countries increased substantially during the s  and I have recently been able to inform the Australian Parliament that it will again increase significantly in the first year of the Second Development Decade    The budget for  provides for US  million of official development assistance that is  assistance under the direction or control of Government  It does not include private capital flows  which are outside our jurisdiction and competence  Mostly  this assistance will be in the form of grants carrying no burden of interest or repayment  This will be an increase of  per cent over the previous financial year  Of this amount   million is appropriated to Asian countries an increase of  per cent over the previous year    I have also recently announced important new plans regarding Australia s intentions to assist  in particular  Indonesia  Cambodia and South VietMam    There is one other aspect of our aid program that I want to mention  We want to ensure flexibility in any statement of aims for the Second Development Decade that may be adopted this year by the Assembly  The reasons are clear  Conditions in the various developing countries are different and require different treatment  Donor countries also face a variety of conditions  and these must influence the commitments they can make    In the view of my Government there has been a tendency  especially here at the United Nations  to concentrate on the gross amount of aid rather than the quantity of official aid and the quality and effectiveness of economic aid  Thus there has been too much preoccupation with percentage targets and dates for reaching them  I have reaffirmed Australia s support for an aid target for donor countries of  per cent of gross national product  as defined by resolution   II  of the second session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which specifically acknowledges the position of capital importing countries like Australia  It is essential  however  not to let debate about the timing and level of targets distract attention from the overall need for donors to increase the amount of their total aid and particularly their official development assistance    I conclude by returning to the present condition of the United Nations and to the faults and merits most of us see in it  Like most large institutions  it threatens to become a prey to bureaucratization  There is a growing danger of rigidity in its proceedings  it threatens to be submerged under an accumulation of paper  committees and subcommittees continue to proliferate and duplication of effort seems to increase    It is a far cry from the day when the late David Owen set up the Secretariat with a desk  a chair and no telephone  Mere survival of the hectic pressures of the three months of a General Assembly session is an achievement in itself  There is a tendency to regard every United Nations resolution as an end in itself and not as a means to an end  In all this there is much room for improvement    It is not basically the Charter that is at fault  though we in Australia would be receptive to change in the Charter if it was thought necessary  We must look elsewhere  Our distinguished SecretaryGeneral  speaking in San Francisco on the twentyfifth anniversary of the signing ceremony  called eloquently on all Member States to  give the Charter a chance   to give it a go and let it succeed    The Foreign Minister of Brazil  in his thoughtful address which opened this debate   reminded us that  with all its shortcomings and frustrations  the United Nations is the only forum in which we can still opt for life  peace and development  As he said  let us use the Organization and let us apply the Charter  We should take this advice to heart    Finally  and above all  we must not lose hope in the United Nations  We must not let ourselves drift into cynicism  We should remember at all times the late Dag Hammarskjold s statement   It is not the Soviet Union nor indeed any ether big Powers who need the United Nations for their protection  it is ail the others  In this sense the Organization is first of all their Organization

       "3     May I begin by expressing to Ambassador Hambro  on behalf of the delegation of Austria  our best wishes on his election as President of this General Assembly    We derive great satisfaction from the knowledge that this twentyfifth session of the United Nations will be held under the Presidency of a man whom we not only admire as an experienced diplomat  but whose background and personality are so germane to the problems and the respect of international law  This may be quite significant at a time when national and international systems of law are exposed to increased attacks and hard tests    As representatives of a European State  we are also happy to see that this twentyfifth anniversary session of the General Assembly happens to be held under a President from our continent  Starting with the first General Assembly of   which convened under the presidency of that European statesman of genuine greatness PaulHenri Spaak and up to this twentyfifth anniversary session  a chain of outstanding personalities coming from all continents has presided over our Assembly  The President of this session is continuing this illustrious tradition    I also wish to use this opportunity to express the sincere gratitude of the Austrian delegation to Mrs  Angie BrooksRandolph  President of last year s General Assembly    A tragic event of the first magnitude has cast a dark shadow on our deliberations  President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic died suddenly on Monday of this week  In him his own country has lost an outstanding leader and the world a statesman who  by opting for a ceasefire followed by negotiations  rekindled the hopes of millions for a peaceful solution of the Near East conflict  We bow our heads to the memory of a great man and extend our heartfelt sympathy to the people of the United Arab Republic in their great bereavement    The twentyfifth anniversary of the United Nations  which came into being after the end of the Second World War out of a genuine desire to free future generations from the scourge of war  is an occasion to consider what has been achieved and also what has been left undone so far  an occasion to examine our conscience and to ask whether each Member State has really made a due contribution to the peaceful cooperation of the peoples of the world  I believe that it should always be borne in mind that the United Nations can successfully exploit the possibilities open to it by the Charter only within the boundaries set for it by the will of all Member States  and especially by the great Powers    Looking back at the developments of the last twentyfive years one is entitled to ask to what extent have we shown respect for the fundamental principles of international law and acted in the spirit of the Charter  Have we  the States Members of this Organization  really refrained in our international relations from the use or the threat of force against the territorial integrity or the political independence of other States  Have the Member States always settled international disputes by peaceful means and in such a way as not to endanger international security and justice  Has the principle been applied that no State should interfere in the domestic affairs of another State  Has the principle of the equality of sovereign States and their peoples and their right to self determination been observed  And  finally  have the States cited out in good faith the obligations assumed under the United Nations Charter    We must acknowledge  regretfully  that there is a flagrant discrepancy between the present international situation and those principles of the Charter and of international law which should have governed friendly relations among States  While we make speeches here  people are fighting and dying in SouthEast Asia and in the Middle East  Horrible acts of air piracy  kidnapping and murder of innocent hostages are increasing in a frightening way  The rules of international law  the principles of the Charter and human rights are trodden underfoot daily and real or imaginary wrongs are avenged by new lawlessness    I believe that this situation  which is of grave concern  can be resolved only if we find our way back to that deep and sincere desire for peace which filled all the nations of the world at the end of the last great war  and if we make the principles of the United Nations Charter the guideline for our conduct  Just as in the domestic life of a State  mutual tolerance must be exercised in relations between communities  as advocated by Comenius the th anniversary of whose death is being commemorated this year when he said   No State receives internal peace as a free gift  it is the expression of mutual give and take  of self restraint  of freedom based on equal and inalienable rights and the dignity inherent in all men  The same applies to external peace  it will not just drop into one s lap without mutual give and take  selfrestraint and continuous effort     Austria  as a permanently neutral State whose national security is closely linked to international stability  is vitally interested in all measures conducive to the strengthening of international security  accordingly  we welcomed the debate at the twentyfourth session of the General Assembly on the item entitled  Strengthening of international security  and conveyed to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations our position and proposals on that item   To come closer to that objective of international security  it is first necessary to strengthen the United Nations as the most important institution for the preservation of world peace and to support it in the fulfillment of its task  The current anniversary session of the General Assembly provides a welcome opportunity to that end     Peace on our planet will be attainable only if each individual State makes its contribution to that end by endeavoring to solve  in the spirit of the Charter  all problems arising with its neighboring States and within its region    Since Europe  too  is not free of such tensions and since Austria has a natural interest in a detente  it welcomed the recent signing of a treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union as an encouraging beginning  It also welcomed the proposal to hold a conference to deal with questions of security and cooperation in Europe  In a series of bilateral talks with interested States  Austria has endeavored to make its contribution to the creation of a generally acceptable basis for such a conference  Austria has outlined its position in a memorandum addressed to all interested States    A minimum of trust is a prerequisite for all cooperation and the foundation for the success of any conference  The best way to build trust remains the fulfillment of treaties and respect for United Nations resolutions  In this connexion it is a source of great satisfaction for me to be able to report to this Assembly on a problem which  in accordance with two resolutions of the General Assembly  it was possible to move appreciably closer to a solution during the last year  namely  the question of South Tirol    By its resolutions   XV  and   XVI  the General Assembly has called upon Austria and Italy to resume negotiations on the implementation of the Paris Agreement of  September   which regulates the status of the Germanspeaking population of the Province of Bozen and establishes a system designed to guarantee to the Germanspeaking inhabitants of the Province of Bozen  complete equality of rights with the Italianspeaking inhabitants  within the framework of special provisions to safeguard the ethnical character and the cultural and economic development of the Germanspeaking element   The talks were to be resumed with the objective of finding a solution to all differences related to the implementation of the aforementioned agreement    Last year  after nine years of effort  Austria and Italy worked out a proposal for a solution which has received  on a democratic basis  the approval of the elected representatives of the people both in Austria and Italy as well as that of the South Tirolean minority  The two Governments have conveyed this information to the States Members of the United Nations through the SecretaryGeneral in documents A  and A  of  July     While the proposed solution could not be based on a reconciliation between the legal positions of the parties concerned  it provides nevertheless for a number of steps to be taken by the Austrian and Italian sides in accordance with a timetable called  calendar of operations   Within its framework and by means of a constitutional law  ordinary laws  executive regulations to the constitutional law and administrative decrees  Italy committed itself to granting a number of legislative and administrative rights to the province of Bo wn the homeland of the South Tiroleans thus expanding the autonomy of that minority    The administrative decrees provided under this timetable of operations have already been issued  The constitutional law was introduced into the Chamber of Deputies by the Italian Government at the beginning of this year and is now under parliamentary consideration  The ordinary laws should be submitted to the Italian Parliament before the end of this year  It is our sincere hope  and we are encouraged therein by the Government declaration of Prime Minister Colombo on  August   that the parliamentary procedures for the projected legislation will not consume too much time  so that its positive political effects may not be impaired by excessive delay    As soon as the measures enumerated and described in detail in the official annex to the Italian Government declaration of  December   which were noted with approval by the Austrian Parliament at its meeting of  December   and which are to be incorporated in a Constitutional Law  ordinary laws and executive regulations to the Constitutional Law  become legally valid in South Tirol  Austria will declare that it considers as terminated the dispute which was the subject of the aforementioned resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations    Hand in hand with the implementation of measures in favor of the South Tirolean minority in Italy  an agreement between Austria and Italy will be signed and submitted to the ratification procedures and  after completion of these steps  will come into force  This will make the provisions of Chapter  of the European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes applicable  in the relations between Austria and Italy  to disputes concerning the interpretation and implementation of bilateral agreements in force between the two parties  also in those cases where disputes refer to facts or situations prior to the coming into force of the aforementioned European convention between the two States    I am happy to acknowledge that  through the new regulation envisaged for autonomy in South Tirol  a cornerstone was laid for a renewed and fruitful cooperation between the two neighboring countries  Austria and Italy  The Austrian Government is firmly  Signed in Strasbourg on  April  under the auspice   of the Council of Europe  resolved to honor its commitments under the proposed solution  At the same time  it confidently trusts that Italy will make its contribution to the further development of friendly and rewarding relations between our two countries by a speedy implementation  in letter and spirit  of the measures envisaged  and also by following a policy of understanding in respect of the South Tirolean ethnic group  Austria is sincerely interested in such a development    Notwithstanding the efforts by European States to arrive at a lessening of tensions and to achieve closer cooperation  the overall political picture of our world remains clouded  It is an undeniable fact that it has not become possible to put an end to warfare in the Middle East and in SouthEast Asia  or even to reduce the hazards the situation in the Middle East presents to world peace  There was no lack of earnest endeavor from various sides  In particular one has to rate highly the efforts deployed by the great Powers to reach a formula acceptable to all parties for settling the differences in the IsraeliArab conflict  The ceasefire and the renewed search for a political solution to the conflict through the interposition of the United Nations mediator  Ambassador Gunnar Jarring  were overshadowed by the sanguinary battles fought in Jordan  In the long run  however  the only hope for a solution would seem to lie in a settlement of the deeply rooted differences among the peoples of the Middle East by peaceful means  Austria is convinced that the Security Council resolution of  November  points to a way that would lead to a peaceful coexistence of the peoples of that area  a region so rich in cultural heritage and economic potential  Austria is prepared to continue its contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in that area and is also willing  whenever it is deemed desirable  to provide observers or contingents even on a larger scale    The war in VietNam goes on and in the course of this year has even spread over a wider area because of the hostilities in Cambodia  While here  too  efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement and a deescalation of military actions should not be overlooked  we cannot refrain from expressing this year again  our serious concern at the continuation of the armed conflict    We hope that in the face of the continuing human suffering and of the apparent deadlock in this horrible war  all sides will eventually realize that here too a political solution and the use of peaceful means can alone lead to a settlement  a suitable basis for which may be provided by the Geneva Agreements of  and   We have to realize that all planning for the future would be pointless  that we would lack credibility unless we succeeded in settling problems of this scope and urgency    Among the grave problems confronting us  I should now like to point with purpose to those occurrences which not only represent a retreat from the fundamental rules of a civilized world  but which may also become a serious threat to the maintenance of peace  I am referring to the increasingly frequent acts of air piracy and bombing attempts against civil aircraft in flight  as well as to the abuse and even slaughter of innocent hostages to enforce political ends  I agree entirely with SecretaryGeneral U Thant when he calls such acts savage and inhuman and asks for effective international measures to prevent the perpetration and spreading of these crimes    In the light of our interest in the strengthening of international security  Austria follows the development of the disarmament talks with the greatest attention  I should like to express here our satisfaction that the two superPowers found themselves ready to engage in negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons  The fact that the latest phase of these talks was held in Vienna underscores anew the relevance of a permanently neutral State as a venue for such meetings  May I express the hope that the continuation of these talks will lead to concrete agreements whereby the threat of an atomic devastation of our planet would be at least diminished  if not altogether removed    At the same time I should like to emphasize the significance of multilateral disarmament efforts which have worldwide disarmament measures as their objective  The coming into force of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons in march of this year was certainly an important step forward  Austria  one of the first countries to ratify this Treaty  appeals to those States which have not yet decided to do so to accede to it  despite the perhaps not entirely balanced commitments between the nuclear and the nonnuclear States  Austria also welcomed the fact that important tasks relating to the implementation of the Treaty were referred to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna    The complexity of the question of disarmament is directly related to the revolutionary progress in science and technology  It is therefore logical that in the last years the United Nations has increasingly directed its attention to the longrange problems which are closely linked to this technical evolution  I am referring here mainly to the practical applications of space technology which are likely to change our daily life in the future  I should also mention  in this context  the attempts to institute a legal system for outer space and the ocean floor and  last but not least  the efforts of the United Nations to preserve the human environment    Despite an encouraging start in the area of legal arrangements for outer space  a slowdown may now be observed in this work  Nor have the efforts to set forth a declaration of principles for the seabed  so far  achieved the desired goal  This immobility must be overcome because  not only in theoretical but also in practical terms  legislative action of the United Nations in these two fields appears to contribute constructively to the future evolution of the world Organization    The technological  scientific and also political developments of the last decades have made the interdependence of human activity all over the globe even clearer  This is evident in the political and  perhaps even more so  in the economic field  Accordingly  industrial States must take into account   n their economic policies  the interests of the developing countries  The United Nations and its subsidiary agencies on their part should carry out the technical preliminary work necessary for a better understanding of the increasing needs and also for the coordination and execution of the various programs  The Second United Nations Development Decade  approved by the twentyfirst session of the General Assembly and designed to reduce the gap between the poor and the rich by promoting the economic growth of the developing countries  thus acquires particular significance  Austria will make its contribution to the goals of this decade and within the limits of its economic possibilities will in particular make every effort to achieve  during that period  a volume of development assistance equivalent to  per cent of its gross national product    The presence in Vienna of important United Nations institutions  particularly the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  and the holding in our country of numerous international conferences underline once again the importance which we attach to the Development Decade  In this regard I wish to point out that the Austrian Government incurred very substantial expenses to provide UNIDO with fully adequate working premises mainly through new construction and we are proud to note that our efforts in this direction were rewarded by the appreciation expressed from all sides  including the Secretary General    Regarding the establishment of a United Nations   city in Vienna  which would serve as headquarters for the organizations already located there  as well as those that would wish to move to Vienna in future  an international competition of urban architecture has now been completed  The projects selected by the jury are now being examined by the Austrian Government in respect of their feasibility  and it may be expected that a decision on the project to be adopted will be made  in consultation with IAEA and UNIDO  even before the end of this year  Austria hopes that by providing the financial support for this undertaking it will make a further valuable contribution towards the attainment of the objectives of the Development Decade    I should like now to point to two more subjects which  in our view  deserve particular attention on the part of the United Nations  I am referring to the fact that the uses and the significance of data processing in economy  education  administration and science have grown to such an extent that individual States can no longer  by themselves  keep pace with this development  At the same time a situation should be avoided in which  because of higher technical capability  individual States or groups of States acquire a monopoly in this important field  The Austrian Association for Data Processing therefore submitted some time ago a memorandum to SecretaryGeneral U Thant  which contains a proposal for the setting up of a central service for the processing and exchange of data within the United Nations framework and which  in addition to the processing of the material  would also have the task of carrying out an objective evaluation of all the data on the basis of unified standards  thus preventing possible manipulations    The second thought I wanted to submit is that  in view of the continuously increasing demands on national administrations and on the secretariats of international organizations  the problem of the auditing of these administrations acquires a growing significance  Austria is happy to be host in Vienna to the International Secretariat of the Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions  which has set itself the task of promoting principles of efficient administrative controls through periodic exchange of experience  In accordance with a wish often expressed by developing countries a seminar has been planned within the framework of that Organization s activities  to be conducted in Austria in the spring of   with assistance from the United Nations Development Program  which will deal with State audit problems at the highest level  with particular emphasis on problems peculiar to developing countries    In conclusion  I should like to go back once again to the phenomenon of the increasing acts of violence occurring both in international and national life  According to Art   paragraph  of the Charter  the primary purpose of the United Nations is to settle international disputes and situations which may lead to a breach of peace by peaceful means and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law  It would therefore be correct to say that the United Nations is built on the principle of  peace through law     The external peace to be ensured in accordance with that principle necessarily implies internal peace within the members of the family of nations as its prerequisite  That internal peace cannot exist  in the long run  inside a State which does not respect the fundamental rights of the person  which are also consecrated by the Charter of the United Nations  Human rights and fundamental freedoms can no longer be exclusively regarded today as the classic rights which we may find in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of  December     The principle of the equality of all men has since been expanded by the codifying activities of the United Nations  aimed at preventing all forms of racial discrimination  Discrimination based on the color of the skin or on ethnic origin  such as we find it today in particular in southern Africa  is therefore liable to compromise external peace  The Austrian Government has repeatedly stated that it rejects the concept of apartheid  which is contrary to the Charter  just as it rejects every other political concept based on racial  religious or ethnic discrimination  I wish to restate this position of ours most emphatically and to stress  in this context  that in the opinion of Austria  the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa  which was endorsed by the twentyfourth General Assembly  points to a practicable way towards the implementation of the Declaration on decolonization adopted ten years ago    The developments in southern Africa are the more alarming since the discriminatory policies  condemned by the whole world  are spreading to an area which by virtue of decisions of this Organization had been placed under the direct responsibility of the United Nations  The inhabitants of Namibia must be given the right freely to determine their future  just as all the other peoples of the world    In connexion with this problem we welcome the decision of the Security Council reflected in its resolution     of  July   which requests an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice regarding  the legal consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia  notwithstanding Security Council resolution       One hopes that the advisory opinion to be handed down by the International Court of Justice will bring this Organization one step nearer to the solution of the Namibian problem    In this connexion  it would seem appropriate for me to say a few words about the International Court itself  We believe that the proposals submitted to the General Assembly to review the role of the Court deserve close study  Those proposals are designed to expand the sphere of action of the Court  and in that context more emphasis could be placed on the concept of the peaceful settlement of disputes  Especially interesting is the idea of setting up regional chambers of the Court which could be used for the settlement of disputes within a given region  To stress the significance which Austria attaches to the role of the International Court of Justice  I should like to state here that the Federal Government of Austria has decided  during these last days  to introduce a bill in Parliament which would provide for the issuance of a declaration under Article   paragraph   of the Statute of the International Court of Justice  according to which Austria will recognize the jurisdiction of the Court as  compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement  in relation to any other State accepting the same obligation     I have focused my remarks more specifically on the aspects of international security and the maintenance of law and order in the world  This in no way means that we underrate the significance of other problems  I am  however  firmly convinced that a firm rededication by all Member States to the principle of friendly relations and cooperation among nations would be an essential step to bring us nearer to peace and to the solution of all pending problems    We must learn from the past that peace  justice and progress form an indivisible whole and constitute as such the condition sine qua non for the survival of mankind

       "4     No doubt each of us  before coming up to this rostrum  wonders about the usefulness or futility of the speech  Must we still speak when our voices are drowned out by the mournful cries of so many victims of the world s disorders  Our reply is yes  provided that  in listening to each other  we become more deeply convinced of our responsibilities  For our part  we shall not extol the successes of the United Nations  nor shall we allow ourselves to be discouraged by its failures  A worldwide order of peace and justice cannot be built in  years    Is it not important in itself that our Organization  conceived in a very different moment of history  has withstood the changes wrought by a single quarter century    In   no one doubts that the United Nations is necessary  On the contrary  people want it to be effective    It seems to us that one thing should encourage us all  It is the fact that in our countries  in mine as in may others  the great principles  of the Charter are impressing themselves more and more on consciences and especially on the consciences of the young  On the one hand we see that in most of our countries many convictions are crumbling  but on the other hand we find stronger support than existed  years ago for the five choices made by our States in   Indeed there is  and particularly among the younger members of our population  an immediate response to the duty to organize collective security  the duty to disarm  the duty to ensure the equitable distribution of goods among all peoples  respect for human rights  and the settlement by arbitration or judicial process of legal disputes between States    All these aims  in our country and in many others  are becoming more and more sacred  imperative and urgent  the failure to observe these principles grows more shocking  and we are therefore urged to hasten the time when these principles and duties will be fulfilled throughout the world    Our response to this expectation is twofold  as we see it  the aims of the United Nations must be tackled on all fronts and  whenever possible  at several levels not only by the central institutions of the United Nations  but also by numerous regional actions    We do not propose the establishment of new institutions  but rather the adaptation and enhancement of those we already have    First of ail we wish and I am saying first of all to strengthen the central institutions of the United Nations  especially for the purpose of achieving two of their main purposes  security and development    Whatever contributes towards making the Security Council more effective will have our support  My country was one of the sponsors of the draft resolution on international security  submitted in the First Committee  which  inter alia  contains specific proposals for strengthening the authority of the Council  But I fully realize that these proposals will not achieve their purpose unless  beforehand  all States Members of our Organization reaffirm their political will to accept and implement the decisions of the Council  in accordance with Article  of the Charter    Furthermore  in specific  limited fields  the Charter delegates to the Security Council real powers  and this  as we see it  foreshadows a world executive in a way  But here  should not the General Assembly support the Council  To that end  we would be in favor of the General Assembly  within the context of Article  of the Charter  pronouncing itself on the action of the Security Council  and hence of its closely studying the annual report of the Council    We also wish to emphasize the importance of the meeting of the Security Council provided for in paragraph  of Article  of the Charter  which should be held in the course of the work of the present session of the General Assembly  We have strongly supported that action in previous years and now reaffirm our support    So much for the field of security  The same holds true with regard to development  We believe that the time is coming when a certain power of decision will have to be vested in a world executive  It is no longer sufficient for the Economic and Social Council or the General Assembly simply to set development targets  some poverty will not be avoided unless  in specific cases  some authority can enforce the necessary action in time  For the purpose of restoring peace  does not the Charter confer such powers on the Security Council  And sometimes the Council exercises them  The same need exists where hunger or underdevelopment are involved    Accordingly  we believe that we are faced with the problem of the exercise of the central authority of the United Nations and of strengthening this Organization    Of course  the question of strengthening the authority of the United Nations also embraces the question of its universality  We welcome the fact that in a quarter of a century the sovereignty of so many formerly dependent territories has been recognized and their admission to membership in the United Nations guarantees it  Such is the irreversible trend of decolonization  But the problem of universality presents itself in another way  Some peoples are represented here only in part or not at all  Their absence is not conducive to peace or to peaceful relations between States  The time is not very far off  we believe  when we will be able to adopt an attitude more consistent with our principles  To achieve this  we must overcome the difficulties which still persist  especially with regard to China    In this particular case  my country has consistently urged  for five years  a solution that would enable the representatives of the Government of the People s Republic of China a State which we recognize to occupy the seat which belongs to China in the General Assembly and in the Security Council  This solution cannot jeopardize the right of the representatives of the Government of the Republic of Taiwan to continue to enjoy the protection of our Charter  and therefore to participate in the work of the United Nations  This is  we believe  the only possibility  until a peaceful settlement enables the dispute between these two Chinese Governments to be composed  We also believe that the peaceful settlement of that dispute would thereby be facilitated    My country regrets that a large number of States have informed us that they do not yet share our view  and we therefore did not wish to express it this year in the form of a draft resolution  But  on the other hand  so far  no one has convinced us that any other attitude would be both more just and more consistent with the Charter  We shall continue our consultations with other Governments in seeking the urgent solution which this important problem demands    We therefore attach the greatest importance to strengthening the central power of the United Nations and to its universality  but we hold it to be equally true that the purposes of the Charter can be successfully achieved  although in part  by means of regional arrangements or organizations  deriving from the spontaneous action of countries grouped together in a given area one action does not exclude the other  one action adding to the other  the one aiding the other    The idea is hardly revolutionary  It is suggested in many parts of the Charter and it has already been put into effect in part but in our opinion  at this time in history  it deserves further reflection and a new impetus  The reasons for this effort can  we think  be formulated in a few proposals    Let us make use of this need  which has become evident and is relatively recent  which compels most States to have recourse to interState  organizations in order to solve their economic  social  communications  supply  market  cultural  scientific and defense problems  which today separate nations can as a rule no longer master by themselves    This necessity for interdependence which is relatively recent  I repeat has created the need today for new regional links of solidarity  These are natural  they are becoming more and more closely knit  each is formed differently by a complex of historical and geographical factors  similarities of human environment  identical needs and aspirations  related political regimes and philosophies  We believe th t we must make use of this natural movement    We must therefore imbue these new institutions with the spirit of the Charter and  in each case  examine whether they cannot constitute  in turn  an initial framework which encompasses the purposes of the United Nations and tries to achieve them first in a regional context  Perhaps some obstacles which impede the power of decision of the Security Council might now be offset by this method    The regional organizations  too  will  of course  remain incomplete and partly prevented from fulfilling their objectives    But if the purposes of the United Nations are thus pursued from the ground to the top and from top to bottom  if the complementarity of action is ensured and  if  of course  the world bodies still have the last word in the event of conflicting policies  then we can hope for a greater measure of overall success in pursuing the purposes of the Charter    Those are the reasons which  in the light of experience  prompt us to cooperate eagerly I am speaking of Belgium in the world organizations and in their decentralized activities and also to participate actively in our region  Europe  in promoting links of regional solidarity and interdependence    That will provide a better understanding of some of the attitudes adopted by my country with regard to the present items and  first of all  I turn to the problems of security    The more than  States which share the territory of Europe cannot forget that in the past  years they have unleashed more wars than the other continents  and that two of them have set the world on fire  As if this were not enough  a cold war has been dividing them for the past quarter of a century  Why has this new situation of conflict not led to a third world war  Because  we believe  very soon and very fortunately bonds of solidarity and interdependence began to create balanced situations  certain transnational groupings in Europe which  due to the cohesion they have acquired and that will be developed further  make possible today the efforts gradually to reduce tensions and then to foster understanding    We have therefore asked ourselves whether  some day  security arrangements of the kind provided for in Article  of the Charter might bring about and guarantee harmony in the territories of the whole of Europe through the establishment of rules and instruments of agreement  conciliation and arbitration of disputes  Here it must be made quite clear that such arrangements can be no substitute for our existing economic solidarity and I am referring to the European Economic Communities or for the existing defense organizations that is  the Atlantic Alliance but they should supplement them  Similarly  if a security agreement for the whole of Europe were to be concluded some day  nor would it replace the task of the Security Council  but would remain subordinated to it through the links provided for in Article  of the Charter    Finally  let us say it  a regional organization for the security of the whole of Europe cannot be achieved so long as there is no political agreement on Berlin  no rules accepted by all on the real equality of States  and so long as the principle of noninterference in the affairs of others is not upheld in practice  Events of only too recent memory show that transitional steps are necessary to temper power politics by establishing collective security  It is therefore necessary  in our opinion  to seek to have such regional security agreements for Europe  not as an immediately obtainable objective  but as an ultimate end to be reached only step by step    It is on the road to European regional security that the time is coming when efforts must be made to endeavor to achieve the first intermediate objectives which would in themselves have farreaching implications  Let the bilateral agreements on economic and social cooperation between countries with different systems become multilateral  let us seek to have the covenants renouncing the use of force  such as the one recently signed by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  apply to Europe as a whole    But for such intermediary agreements to be really credible  the negotiations themselves should at the same time make it possible to establish at least the principles and general outlines of a gradual and parallel reduction in regional armaments in Europe  both those stationed there and national armaments  And that leads us to the second problem  disarmament    What purpose does it really serve to declare solemnly that we renounce the use of force  if we continue to pile up the instruments of force  It follows that the renunciation of force and the reduction of armaments are two indivisible elements    Certainly the problem of disarmament has already been raised at the world level  but since we want the coming decade to be that of disarmament  it would be worth while to pursue this aim at several levels  the negotiations of the  at Geneva have borne some fruit  the bilateral socalled SALT negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union do not seem to be ineffective    But what can and should Europe do  Europe which harbors so many tactical and conventional means of destruction  Should it take regional steps to disarm  For a long time now Belgium has strongly believed that it should  and is prepared to participate in such negotiations  in which the United States and Canada would of necessity have to be parties too  We hope that such negotiations will be possible as soon as the practical and wellknown conditions for the ratification in Bonn of the GermanSoviet Treaty have been met  and provided nothing else transpires to darken this horizon  Then the active preparation of initial conferences on European security could be organized  We will contribute  as in the past  to this first approach to regional security    The second area in which central and regional actions can be combined without being merged  but complement each other  is development    We have spoken about the Disarmament Decade  It will also be the Development Decade  The two are not unrelated  The strategy for the Second Development Decade has already been discussed at length and formulated  and in this context the volume and terms of the financial aid for development are particularly noteworthy    That is why Belgium is happy to be able to announce that its total aid will exceed  per cent of its gross national product in   as in previous years  Moreover  it wishes to stress that its public aid rose  per cent in   and  per cent in   which placed it fourth among the industrialized countries  This public aid will further increase in   by  per cent    Lastly  and above all  the Belgian Government  mindful of the needs and hopes of the developing countries  decided on  September   a few days ago  to place before Parliament a Program under which public aid would in  reach the figure of   per cent of that year s gross national product  This decision is a milestone in our policy  but its scope will be very limited unless it forms part of a joint effort by the industrialized countries    As we know very well  a common effort should not be focused only on the financing of development  It should encompass trade policy  a commodities price policy and support for the developing country s own efforts in all areas  especially that of regional cooperation and integration  This will in all likelihood require revision and adaptation of the process of world discussion    We believe furthermore that here again regional initiatives can  through individual arrangements with certain developing countries  add a dimension and a form of particularly effective mutual cooperation  I am thinking of the European communities which  through the Yaounde Convention and the Arusha Declaration of January  and through aid to associated European countries  make a contribution which  in some fields  supplements and increases the effects of bilateral assistance    As regards Latin America  we view with sympathy the efforts at progressive integration of the States of that part of the world  and we particularly welcome the spirit which  at the last meeting of the Special Commission for Latin American coordination in July  motivated the Buenos Aires Declaration on the problems of relations with the European Economic Communities    In turn Belgium hopes that the European Com munites  as they develop and expand  will be able to give Western Europe a new image  It will not be one of hegemony  it cannot be one of neutrality  it will not be one of dependency  What  then  would be the attitude of Europe  in the process of unification  to the world  None other than one of intensive cooperation in the development of the southern hemisphere    Today we must make provision for the economic and social restoration and rehabilitation of the regions affected by the conflict in the Middle East  In that particular case my country is well aware that no real solution will be forthcoming as long as the Palestinian refugees have no home nor the economic means for their development    Belgium announces that it will participate in any European plan for rehabilitating the devastated areas which will enable those refugees to settle in a stable and happy environment  We have submitted to the European agencies the plan drawn up for this purpose by a Committee headed by the President of the Belgian Senate  Once formulated  a Program of European cooperation would help the parties to the conflict in their search for peace    On a more immediate and completely bilateral level  in swift response to the moving appeal of our President and of the SecretaryGeneral  the Belgian Government immediately decided  a few days ago  to make a very substantial contribution in aid for the many victims of the recent events in Jordan    More generally  I cannot speak of the conflict in the Middle East without once again reaffirming the Belgian Government s wholehearted support for all diplomatic efforts aimed at ensuring the swift and full implementation of the Security Council s resolution of  November    Unfortunately  three years have already gone by since the essential conditions for a political settlement of the Middle East question were laid down  We venture to hope that both the spirit and the letter of the ceasefire agreement of  August last  which we welcomed as a happy event  will be respected by the parties concerned  We are anxious to see the early resumption of the talks initiated by Ambassador Jarring    We have just dealt with subjects of collective security  disarmament and cooperation for development  and we noted that the convergence of actions at the world level and of regional initiatives could bring closer the time when the purposes of our Charter will be more effectively fulfilled    Similar thoughts come to mind too in connexion with human rights  economic and social cooperation and international justice    True  when we speak about the protection of the human person  it would be impossible to guarantee safety from certain evil practices only through international agreements or regulations  and I have in mind here particularly the present crimes of hijacking and the detention or execution of diplomats  In regard to the former  my country will put forward its suggestions at the diplomatic conference to be held in December at The Hague and  for the international protection of diplomats  consuls and ministers  it advocates the urgent convening of an ad hoc diplomatic conference    But when we envisage a more general approach to the question of respect for human rights  here again we find an example of cases where regional action can supplement that of our General Assembly  We recall that in  we drew up here  for the whole world  a Universal Declaration of Human Rights    But we can go further in the definition and protection of human rights when regional communities of States allow themselves to be motivated by a stable democratic conscience which is expressed therein  Eighteen European countries did so in   by drawing up the European Charter of Human Rights and  in addition  by setting up a European court on human rights to which individuals can have recourse when their rights are challenged  Several States  including Belgium  in the past already felt it an honor to amend their national legislation at the request of the Court to bring it into line with the decisions of that Court    The same will apply to economic and social cooperation  The United Nations already has instruments of regional cooperation  It is in the regional economic commissions that the ideas of integration were born  which took shape in Latin America and are striving to emerge in Africa  It was on their initiative that development banks were founded  it was they who launched numerous projects in the most varied fields from industry to agriculture  and from natural resources to transportation    Nevertheless  we would like those commissions henceforth to play an even greater role  so as to achieve the goals of the Second Development Decade  especially in the formulation of plans and the evaluation of progress    As far as the Economic Commission for Europe is concerned  it already plays a leading role in coordinating the efforts made  with a view to improving goodneighborly relations among European States  as we read in resolution   XX   In this context or elsewhere  we think that in Europe the time has come to embark on a frank and thorough review of relations between the groupings of the market economy countries and the Stateeconomy countries    The last subject in regard to central action and regional action is that of international justice  Indeed  in that field we also see that in some cases regional initiative or action are possible  that is described in Article  of the Charter which advocates the settlement of disputes between States by way of good offices  mediation  conciliation and arbitration  That Article provides that those actions can be carried out by regional agencies  The Organization of African Unity has established this type of machinery under the Charter  and we believe this to be a good thing    True  the International Court of Justice   the supreme tribunal in legal disputes and must  in the final analysis  guarantee the universality of international law  However  here again we cannot forget that States parties to regional legal disputes may  by virtue of the Statutes of the Court itself  Article   paragraph   ask that chambers be formed for dealing with a particular case  For such cases  and if the question of reactivating the International Court of Justice is looked into further  as requested by the United States  Belgium will submit to it the question whether  in particular cases and on very precisely determined occasions  regional ad hoc chambers could be formed  while at the same time upholding the universal character of the United Nations and the universality of international law    My country has not been developing an abstract thesis today nor has it claimed that regional initiatives are some kind of panacea for the world  We are merely convinced that the spirit of the Charter can and must manifest itself in many places  and that we must not expect everything from initiatives at the world level  nor of course can we expect everything from regional initiatives  however  if they supplement one another  we may find herein a source of progress or initiatives which are being taken in different places    We have noted that the past  years especially in Europe but also in Africa  Latin America and the Middle East have been characterized by the emergence of numerous regional bodies and firm multilateral ties  To be sound and lasting  these must always be spontaneous and leave each people free to be associated with them  to be excellent  they must draw their inspiration from the principles of the Charter and seek  within that context also  to further their progress  By adding that dimension to our efforts  we have noted  it is possible to increase the opportunities for collective security  disarmament  cooperation for development  respect for human rights  economic and social understanding and international justice    Allow me  Mr  President  to ask you to convey to Mr  Hambro the tribute which my country wishes to extend to him  My delegation is extremely gratified to see the eminent representative of Norway presiding over our deliberations  Norway and Belgium already participate in many enterprises which I earlier called intermediate  Several Western and European ties of solidarity already bind us  and you know how happy we should be if the accession of Norway to the European Communities were to bring us even closer together  We congratulate the President for having brought to the highest office of the United Nations not only the virtues of his people  but also his own personal qualities of erudition  experience and authority    I would not wish to conclude without expressing again our great regard for the SecretaryGeneral of our Organization which  on behalf of my country  I have already had the honor to convey many times before from this rostrum  I wish to end my statement by once again assuring him of our highest esteem

       "7502  On behalf of the people and the Government of Yemen  I would like to congratulate the President most warmly on presiding over the General Assembly at its seventieth session  I wish him every success  I have come today from the brave and strategic city of Aden  which is experiencing great joy because it has been liberated from the Houthi militia and former President Saleh  Yet I am troubled to see the degree of damage that was left in the wake of those criminal militias  including the destruction of the city and the violence against its civilians  The tragedy is continuing in the cities of Taiz and Marib  It beggars the imagination to think that the number of martyrs just in Aden alone has reached    while the number of injured has reached    One can only imagine what the numbers are in Taiz  Marib  AlBaydhah  Abyan and other Yemeni cities  Three years ago  I addressed the Assembly and spoke of the different measures that we had undertaken in our country in order to ensure a successful political transition of power in a spirit of peace and in compliance with the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and its implementation mechanism and pursuant to relevant resolutions of the Security Council  see A  PV    I said then that Iran was hampering that process  It was training Houthi militias and providing them with weapons  delivered by boat or by other vessels  in order to impose the Iranian model in Yemen  Between that time three years ago and today  we have worked tirelessly on a peaceful political transition aimed at preparing the broad  yearlong national dialogue  bringing together all the political forces of Yemen and setting an honourable precedent       A  PV  in our country and the region  That was followed by a transparent process for drafting a secular  democratic modern constitution  The Assembly followed the political time lines and dates as they arose and provided direct support  SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon also provided direct support and visited our country  All elements of Yemeni society  including the Houthis  were part of the process  In addition  there have been visits by the Special Envoy of the SecretaryGeneral and the Security Council  as well as the adoption of relevant Security Council resolutions and presidential statements  Despite all that  as the political transition process was drawing to a close and just when the constitution was supposed to be submitted to a popular referendum  the Houthis and Saleh staged a military and political coup d  tat  occupying the capital  Sana a  and wreaking havoc on hospitals  mosques  Quranic schools  homes and residences  Every form of weaponry was used  including arms from the Yemeni army  The tragedies in Aden  Taiz and Ad Dali could be characterized as genocide  Indeed  it was a desperate attempt to impose the Iranian model through the use of force  Political leaders and thousands of citizens either disappeared or were killed  The media were also affected  Thousands of children were forcibly conscripted  antipersonnel mines were planted and schools  public buildings and homes were converted into weapons storage facilities and barracks  Houthi militia threatened to spread to neighbouring countries  thereby endangering regional and international peace and security  We attempted to have a dialogue with Saleh and the Houthis  giving them immunity and every opportunity and including them in national dialogue  but they retained their weapons and refused to create a political party in accordance with established law  That was all accepted despite the events that took place in   Saleh s fight has never been a peaceful one  as was  for example  the peaceful southern movement  in Sa dah province  which saw its citizens expelled  The Houthis seized military areas and took control by force  Despite our positive approach to that armed movement and various understandings with the Houthi movement  agreements were repeatedly cast aside and a coup d  tat was carried out against the State  and people were maltreated and severely punished  The actions of the Houthi militias  as well as those of Saleh  led us to appeal to neighbouring countries in the Gulf under Article  of the Charter of the United Nations  We appealed for assistance in tackling the Houthi militias that were undermining and threatening national legitimacy  The response was courageous  Our brother His Majesty Salman Bin Abdulaziz AlSaud  of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  acted with utter determination  On behalf of the Yemeni people  I would like to convey our sincere thanks to His Majesty King Salman and to all members of the coalition who are pursuing efforts to assist the Yemeni people  We are joined together in blood in this battle for our country and for the legitimacy of the State in order to prevent the country from falling into the hands of Iran  which would like to see the destruction of the country and to control the Bab alMandab strait  The Yemeni people have opposed attempts by the Houthis in Aden  Abyan  AlBaydhah  Taiz  Hodeidah and other cities of Yemen  The people have upheld the law  I would like to commend the efforts of the brave national resistance and the national armed forces  who are indeed our partners in struggle and in victory  construction and development  The Assembly is aware of the human tragedy that has befallen our people as a result of the blockade imposed by the militias  which continue their coup d  tat  The Assembly is also aware of the deterioration and destruction of public services in liberated provinces  Greater international effort is needed to alleviate the human suffering and to ensure that the Yemeni crisis is not forgotten  While the United Nations has announced an appeal for humanitarian assistance for Yemen  annual contributions continue to fall short and cover only a meagre portion of the actual need  I therefore take this opportunity to appeal once again to donor countries to ensure that they provide promised assistance  The Government of the Republic of Yemen would like to see the arrival of emergency humanitarian assistance to provide for all provinces without exception  An oversight mechanism for humanitarian convoys  as proposed by the United Nations  would allow for the return of economic prosperity and would facilitate the arrival of humanitarian assistance through all Yemeni ports  Furthermore  the Government has been moved to Aden  I believe that that will lead to better living conditions for our citizens  It will also reestablish basic services  which have been destroyed by the militias of the Houthis and Saleh  Without a doubt  and quite clearly  that remains the best way for me to remain side by side with my heroic and steadfast people  That has been our position since    A  PV     the very beginning of the conflict  We have cooperated with all genuine efforts on the part of the international community and  in particular  with those of Secretary General Ban Kimoon and Mr  Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed  the Special Envoy of the SecretaryGeneral  to end the coup d  tat  pursuant to Security Council resolution      Since that resolution  the political process has been resumed  guided by the results of the national dialogue and facilitated by the Gulf Cooperation Council  Allow me to reiterate that all efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the political crisis should be welcomed and supported  Once again  I would like to convey to the rebels  the HouthiSaleh militias  that they must lay down their weapons  act in line with reason and implement resolution     in earnest  I have come here to support peace and accord  I am talking not about a divisive peace but rather of a permanent peace that will be a source of law and order  cohesion and justice  Allow me to advocate for the literal implementation of the most recent Security Council resolution  namely  resolution      which bears the credibility of the Council itself  I hope that the efforts of the United Nations will be crowned with success  That will ensure that we act in accordance with the aspirations of our people  who have been exceedingly patient and sincere  Terrorism represents a real threat to States  To the extent of our ability  we have tried to combat terrorism  against which we have conducted a determined campaign  in partnership with friendly countries  The coup d  tat and the extremism that ensued created a breeding ground for terrorism  I would like to reiterate  however  our confidence in and support for the Government  which is leading the fight against terrorism with international aid  Given the geographical and strategic location of Yemen  the stability of our country buttresses the stability of the region and the world  The seventieth session of the General Assembly coincides with the glorious September and October revolutions of my country  I would like to express my thanks and gratitude to all the Yemeni people  who are a proud and patient people  I would like to restate my commitment to achieving the goals of those two glorious revolutions  We will not allow minority groups  Houthis or others  to repeat the Iranian experience in Yemen  At this time   years since the birth of the United Nations  an Organization that has succeeded in lessening conflicts and wars through its very principles  we reiterate our commitment to working on behalf of future generations  That represents a commitment to those generations  as well as a commitment to making the world more prosperous  safer and free through unity and true determination to achieve the noble ambitions  on which our Organization was established  The Republic of Yemen condemns in the strongest terms the systematic Israeli attacks against the AlAqsa Mosque  Once again  we express our permanent support for the Palestinian people  who are determined to protect the Mosque  A question necessarily arises regarding those recent events  A Government that was created by resolutions of the Security Council refuses to abide by those same resolutions  That is truly surprising  I would like to thank SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon for his important efforts to achieve the noble ambition of our Organization to ensure international peace and security  I would also like to thank him for his great and commendable efforts to promote the political transition in Yemen  reverse the coup d  tat and restore State authority  We wish every success to the General Assembly at its seventieth session

       "7503  Seventy years have passed since the establishment of the United Nations  People live differently now  many changes have taken place and many reforms have been effected  It is time that we reform the United Nations as well  I call on the President to speed up this process during his mandate  Perhaps no other session in the history of the General Assembly has come at a more opportune time  Last year saw many new developments  Negotiations  which were unimaginable before  were started to end the embargo on Cuba  An agreement was reached to lift sanctions on Iran  We recognize those who took part in making these historic decisions and encourage them to see these changes through to completion  This is very much in line with the policy my country has pursued for a number of decades  The world of today does not resemble the world of yesterday  and none of us can remain indifferent to this fact  Ours used to be a bipolar world  divided into blocs  We did not thrive because the poles were violently    A  PV     opposed to one another and had access to the most dangerous weapons the world possessed at the time  But we are also not doing well in a world with one Power that carries out diplomacy by issuing threats  oblivious to the concerns of all others  including those of the United Nations  Peoples and States attend to their own interests and are thereby exposed and open to extremist religious fanatics  giving rise to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and other extremist movements  These terrorist groups now threaten millions of people and have created a negative image of Islam  the religion on whose behalf they profess to act  The two key elements of law and ethics were once key in international relations and politics  United States President Woodrow Wilson was a staunch advocate  while the great Serbian poet Njego  expressed it in verses of The Mountain Wreath in the following way  Along his path who maketh Might his right Rise stenches of inhuman cruelty     As Wolf doth on the Sheep impose his might  So tyrant lords it over feebler fellow  But foot to place upon the Tyrant s neck  To bring him to the consciousness of Right   This of all human duties is most sacred Today  however  legal and ethical factors are essentially being eclipsed in international politics  Not infrequently  unlawful and exceedingly immoral actions are being taken  purportedly for ethical and legal reasons  This happens most often when a clear legal norm that brooks no exception   such as the need for the Security Council to take a decision  for instance   stands in the way of a major Power achieving its geopolitical goals  International law  therefore  and the moral tenets underpinning a legal norm and its implementation  are deeply in crisis today  There is ample evidence of this  including the most recent largescale crisis  Some call it a migrant crisis  others refer to it as another wave of people migrating for various reasons  What worries us  though  is that those who think that efforts should be intensified in the hope of restoring peace quickly and easily and promoting economic progress for all   developing countries  in particular   are few and far between  We ought to look each other in the eye and assess the past year with an open mind  We ought to announce what has been achieved in our countries  Some of us ought to ask themselves if their actions helped humankind or threatened the future of our children  Can we still begin our speeches with  We  the peoples of the United Nations   Are we any closer to peace and prosperity or are we rushing  with blindfolds on  towards another   which saw the start of a major world tragedy that lasted six years and whose consequences we shall never be able to erase  Some of the mighty and powerful seem to believe that the world economic crisis did not do enough to terrify our children and their parents  They continue to use highly sophisticated weapons to drive people from their homes and countries and thrust them  in fear for their lives  into the turmoil of migration  journeying thousands of kilometres in a world without food  water or electricity  The responsibility for these developments lies not with those who struggle to fight poverty and create conditions in their countries conducive to a dignified human life  or with Serbia  which has opened soup kitchens in order to give many their only daily meal  It lies with those who have much  whether Godgiven or gained by exploiting others  It lies with those who spend more on arms than all the world s poor countries together spend on food  It lies with all of us  because we cannot contemplate sustainable development without accepting our shared responsibility to tackle one of the world s major challenges   eradicating or at least alleviating poverty  I often wonder how parents can look their children in the eye as they tell them that school and learning are important for their future and a normal life  and try to convince them that they will have food on their plates once they finish school and acquire learning  We do not learn when we live in fear  have nothing to eat or are threatened by disease  when our parents are unemployed or we face the threat of a terrible war  Those here representing the rich and powerful should think about that as they put their children to bed in a warm room at night and make important decisions during the day  Are profits and political or military superiority really worth so much that we no longer feel the sufferings of others but rather let baser instincts take over  Peace and prosperity cannot be a privilege for the people of certain countries alone  every man and woman on planet Earth has a right to them  That       A  PV  is why we hold out a helping hand in our quest to achieve the Goals of the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  resolution    through shared actions aimed at creating a better future for humankind  based on principles that can ensure progress and prosperity for all  Sustainable development is clearly a concept accepted by most of the world  It postulates a global economy linking every region of the world on a basis of trust  ethics  equality and support  as well as a comprehensive approach to managing development by analysing and assessing the efforts of Governments and businesses  All management  however  requires that certain rules be established  and the question therefore is  Who will establish the rules and where  Can individuals  or groups of individuals  foresee all possible future events and developments  and is it possible to control those events and developments at all  Are we simply establishing a new global power centre  oblivious to the individual specifics of States or groups of States  an organization that has only one solution to all problems  What can we do about the fact that some of the Goals do not correspond to some countries  specific situations  We must understand that we cannot control everyone s lives even if we think it may be risky to leave things up to their free will  Major changes in the way we live demand that we allow time to adjust to ensure that basic values do not collapse  Today  the world is extraordinarily interconnected in miraculous  virtual ways  information is exchanged and people and goods move at unprecedented speed  But the people themselves have never been so alienated  In huge cities  amid millions  people die alone  Individuals  States and international organizations become alienated  There are many reasons for this  Increasingly  relations among States are based on the more powerful  affluent and developed imposing their will on others  We hope that our new era will usher in a new beginning  a new way of thinking  whose essence will be  as it should  in the best interests of people and their immediate and larger communities  We all understand that this is not easy to achieve  for modern communications can be used to impose a way of thinking aimed at implementing ideas that are not in the interests of the majority  Modern man s urge to conform and daily struggle to meet ever greater demands  along with the spectre of unemployment and hardships in later life  undermine his resolve to resist increasingly evident violations of basic human rights  The world today is tragically divided between a few enormously rich individuals and a majority who live outside the boundaries of human dignity  The twentyfirst century threatens to be an age in which some countries accumulate and concentrate enormous individual wealth and the rest are consigned to poverty and uncertainty  Among those wealthy individuals is also an entirely new generation of privileged directors who  unjustifiably and immorally  are paid far more than their employees  It seems  however  that the numbers of those willing to protest this phenomenon has been growing to a point where their demands may have to be acceded to  I urge everyone to work together to help to achieve an equitable distribution of the world s assets and resources  We continue to talk noncommittally about another major challenge  that of climate change  as if its consequences were not patently evident everywhere  and as if we did not see that they are exacerbating the friction caused by the already high level of inequality in the world  In a wakeup call of sorts  the consequences of our past and current actions now have the greatest effect on the weakest of us  the countries that are still undeveloped industrially and struggling to provide their citizens with a better life  Most developing countries account for just a fraction of global warming  They must be given the opportunity to grow their economies under the same conditions that have already enabled other countries to prosper  even though their greenhouse gas emissions may be higher than the rich would like  We must develop technologies that can enable developing countries to develop while being as environmentally responsible as possible  rather than using concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global warming as pretexts to allow their industry to stagnate  There are moral reasons  too  for ensuring that countries develop  Politicians should be tasked with providing full support to scientific activities  on the one hand  and harmonizing and coordinating responses to climate change and extreme weather situations  on the other  Adapting and preparing national and social responses to potential scenarios  including worstcase scenarios  should be our most basic and important goal  Serbia s Government and scientific institutions  in full compliance with the relevant international documents  first and foremost among them the United    A  PV     Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC  and the Kyoto Protocol  will continue to contribute to the activities of the United Nations and other organizations  primarily through European and regional initiatives on climate monitoring and reducing the negative effects of climate change  Serbia welcomes the forthcoming twentyfirst session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC to be held in Paris later this year  We intend to support and make a full contribution to consideration of this important issue  We will continue to work together with others as a team and an active participant  in hopes that scientists will come up with clear answers and irrevocable proof as soon as possible  while politicians support them and implement speedy  effective solutions  We can hope for a better future only if we overcome problems such as hunger  wars and diseases  Serbia has therefore actively participated in peacekeeping operations all over the world and has made every effort to train and equip growing numbers of its officers and soldiers to take part in such important assignments  In that regard  this year Serbia s chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been universally commended  including by those currently in conflict situations  I should also add that Serbia has been a candidate country of the European Union for more than three years now and has continued to take decisive steps to harmonize its systems and practices with European Union standards  At the same time  Serbia has also continued to maintain its cooperation and friendship with Russia and China  A State is made up of its territory  its people  its languages and its cultural heritage  Serbia is the only country in Europe that in addition to seeing part of its territory seized  its people expelled and their murders and the socalled harvesting of their organs going unpunished  has now had to deal with attacks on its cultural heritage under the protection of UNESCO  Here I recall that in March   in the face of only sporadic opposition from the Kosovo Force  KFOR   Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija destroyed numerous Christian Orthodox churches  other church buildings  convents  bell towers and monastery libraries and archives  usually by setting fires or explosive devices  That was only the brutal and effective perpetuation of the damage and destruction of over  Orthodox sanctuaries perpetrated since the arrival of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the KFOR in June   In that period  the Albanian terrorists systematically destroyed the spiritual and cultural heritage of the Serbian people in Kosovo and Metohija  Their centurieslong existence there is evinced in the many monasteries and churches whose foundations were laid before the ninth century and represent Serbian deeds etched in stone  the testimony of the Serbian presence in Kosovo and Metohija  At the thirtyfirst session of its General Conference  UNESCO confirmed that a crime against a cultural heritage was committed in Kosovo and Metohija  In the small territory of Kosovo and Metohija  UNESCO has registered  highly valuable cultural monuments of the Serbian people  as clearly defined by UNESCO standards  As many as  monuments from the Middle Ages have been identified as a part of European and world heritage in which humankind can take pride and honour  Specifically  they served our pride and honour  These invaluable and unique works of art and architecture have survived five centuries of Ottoman rule  the Balkan Wars and the First and Second World Wars  Yet  there they were  in   being savagely desecrated and destroyed  buried and ploughed over  as though that undertaking was a part of preparations  designed with meticulous precision  to coincide with the unilateral declaration of independence of the Republic of Kosovo  an event that ensued four years after the barbaric destruction of the patrimony of Serbia s Christian culture and civilization  Not only Serbian  but also European culture and the world s collective memory are preserved in Kosovo and Metohija  representing an important human civilizational achievement on planet Earth  It is therefore important that Serbia  as a member of UNESCO  continues to be the keeper of this cultural treasure  which belongs both to Serbia and to the world  In an attempt to falsify history   unfortunately with the support of a certain number of countries   Albania has submitted  on behalf of the Pristina Administration  a request to UNESCO that the Serbian heritage be declared Kosovar   that is  Albanian  Those who strategically destroyed monasteries with the aim of marginalizing the importance of Kosovo and Metohija for the Serbs and of establishing a new ethnic and cultural identity for Kosovo and Metohija on the ashes of the history of others  would be rewarded in that way  How is it possible that arsonists and destroyers  with goals that clearly go beyond all the ethical norms and established rules on which UNESCO was founded        A  PV  are now trying to project themselves as guardians and protectors  Should that request be accepted nonetheless  a dangerous precedent would be set and the door would be opened for the legitimization of violence against the national  cultural and religious identity of any people anywhere  By defending the right of Serbia to preserve and proudly present its identity and cultural heritage  as it has done for the past  centuries  by preventing the unscrupulous dispossession of one s heritage and its attribution to somebody else  we are defending the underlying principles of international law and human justice  as well as those on which UNESCO was founded  I therefore call on all Heads of State not to allow the Serbian people to have its soul excised  its essence usurped and its monasteries in Kosovo and Metohija  its spiritual backbone  declared the cultural heritage of the Albanian people there  In short  that is neither the truth nor a historical and scientific fact  It is not justice  Peoples do not acquire history and civilization by snatching centuries of the existence of others or by bribing  with Judas  silver  those to whom the history of others means nothing and who would stand by indifferently if the spiritual and cultural roots of a people   in this case of we Serbs   were removed from the areas from which they had been expelled  The United Nations must preserve its credibility and stand up to the injustice and evil that Serbia would suffer if the Organization acquiesced to that undertaking  I am certain that those gathered here  as responsible and honourable persons of State  will stand up against the injustice and wrong that would be inflicted upon Serbia and could have a domino effect on other nations and States  Serbia is talking to the representatives of the Administration in Pristina  It will fulfil all its obligations under Security Council resolution     and all its obligations under the agreements reached in Brussels  but it will never  ever recognize the independence of part of its territory  the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija  to which its very existence is connected  The problem of the mass migration from the Middle East is the greatest challenge of our times  We cannot analyse the causes and or identify those directly and indirectly responsible for the migrant crisis here and now  It is an issue of paramount importance and should be addressed at an international forum that would bring together prominent leaders and eminent scholars and scientists  That is the best way to assess the situation objectively  provide an answer and propose a solution to that complex problem  The humanitarian disaster facing the world is only a consequence of the crisis that has shaken Syria for the past four years  all along without an adequate response from the international community  Without access to common funding  the situation of Serbia is perhaps more difficult than that of the other countries of the old continent  Despite its difficult economic situation  Serbia is making every effort to provide decent conditions and accommodation for refugees  However  if the international community  and the European Union above all  fails to make concrete efforts to solve the problem  a humanitarian catastrophe of an even larger scale would threaten SouthEast Europe  The consequences are impossible to foresee  but they would surely affect not only Europe  but the whole world as well  As regards the number of asylum seekers in the Republic of Serbia    persons arrived in Serbia between  January and  September  and only  have submitted asylum requests  I would like to draw attention to the alarming practice of some Governments that have erected wire and razor fences to ghettoize the asylumseekers fleeing war and destitution  Such an attitude runs counter to the  Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the proclaimed solidarity of the States members of the European Union with migrants  It also aggravates the situation in countries that respect international law and treat the individuals struck by calamity humanely  The Governments of certain States Members of the United Nations behave as if they had never abandoned the ideology that prevailed before the end of the Second World War  thereby destroying the fragile stability in the Balkans that was achieved through hard work and dedication  to which Serbia contributed the most  My country has had to cope with a deep economic crisis since   Refugees  therefore  cannot expect to secure much more than their personal safety in Serbia  We will provide it to them irrespective of the fact that certain countries also intervene against people living in Serbian territory  Our care for humankind and our empathy for those in need  as well as our resolve to give those people what we may not need as urgently as they do at the moment  will not diminish  Our borders are open to receive them and to let them through  We need no law for that because that is the way we are  Serbia is    A  PV     not a member of the European Union  but it consistently implements the proclaimed principle of solidarity  a fundamental value and the supposedly unconditional mainstay of the Union itself  I do not understand this selfishness  and sometimes even the hatred towards those who have nothing that some individuals have come to nurture  If the rapid pace with which the leaders of some countries are losing their cool and composure are any clue  the situation can only deteriorate  We therefore need a comprehensive plan that would have to be implemented within the shortest possible time  Without such a plan  migrants will be left altogether at the mercy of human smugglers  Passivity and the increasingly inhumane treatment of migrants open a market for smugglers  The sequence of catastrophes that would ensue in such a case  from the Mediterranean to the British Isles  would be tragic  and the tragedy in which over  people died would be remembered as just one sad link in that sorry chain  Even though it was not directly involved in the conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia in the s  started and stagemanaged in a similar way to the conflict in Syria  Serbia was labelled guilty  A resolution was even recently submitted to the Security Council to stigmatize the Serbs as an example of a genocidal people  although such a characterization of any people in the world is unjustifiable  The attempt failed  as members of the Security Council were aware of the true intentions and desires of the initiators  as well as the possible catastrophic consequences  What kind of genocidal criminals are we  Is it the image imparted by the footage of migrants in Serbia  undaunted and unworried about the reaction of our people and authorities  unlike elsewhere in the region  or is it the image of a hospitable people with a kind heart  Have Serbian citizens changed  They have not  The people of Serbia of all ethnicities have  now and in the past  been humane and hospitable  as well as good neighbours  In addition to refugees from Syria  Afghanistan  Pakistan and Iraq  Serbia hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons from the territory of the former Yugoslavia  They are preponderantly Serbs  but include also Bosniaks  Croats  Roma and others  Some of these people have gone to third countries  while others continue to live in Serbia  We are still faced with the consequences of these migration as they have altered the demographic  social and other structures of our country and society  Then and now  my country has not had much to offer to these destitute people who left their homes  It has shared the little it had  Serbia expects the United Nations Member States to act responsibly and humanely  We should all bear in mind that this situation will have global consequences  Civilization is at a crossroads  Europe is going through serious travails and tribulations  Now is the time for it to show if it still is the standardbearer in the implementation of human rights and the respect of international law or if it continues to turn a blind eye to the apparent double standards and allows the attainment of civilization to be valid only for some countries and some peoples  Equality is applicable not only to relations among individuals  but also to relations among States  Our fathers shed blood on many battlefields for the equality of all peoples  They fought for our freedom to speak our mind and for our opinion to be strong enough to change things  Freedom and equality are the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations  of numerous international documents and of national constitutions  We must not allow them to become dead letters  By taking up these topics and drawing members  attention to them  I hope to motivate us to show genuine empathy and solidarity  to take responsibility for the future and to build  together and indefatigably  true humanism in the Organization that gathered us together here today  I would like us to meet in this place with different messages next year and  if not with our problems solved  then at least with steps made towards solving the problems that burden us today  I would like us to be better every coming year  I would like the States of the world to feel that the ideas of liberty and equality and of a humane and just society are not just empty rhetoric  but instead genuinely resolve to implement them throughout our planet



       "7504  I should like to congratulate the President and his country  Denmark  on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session  He has South Africa s full support for his presidency  The theme that he has chosen   The United Nations at   the road ahead for peace  security and human rights   is timely and relevant to the current global challenges facing the world today  Furthermore  allow me to convey our gratitude to the President of the Assembly at its sixtyninth session  Mr  Sam Kutesa of the Republic of Uganda  for the outstanding manner in which he represented Africa at the helm of the General Assembly during that session  The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations marks a significant moment in the history of global governance  The Charter embodies  through its principles and objectives  the aspirations of oppressed people worldwide  We would also like to acknowledge the role of the United Nations General Assembly over the past  years  Rooted in the principle of sovereign equality  the Assembly is the most representative international institution and organ of the United Nations  The General Assembly has over the years remained central to the provision of support to the disadvantaged  marginalized  occupied  colonized and oppressed peoples of the world  This body elevated the South African struggle for liberation internationally when it declared apartheid a crime against humanity  Mr  Oliver Tambo  the former President of our liberation movement  the African National Congress  addressed the General Assembly from this very podium on  October   see A  PV   and spoke from other United Nations platforms as well on other occasions  Many other eminent South Africans were provided an opportunity in various United Nations forums to state our case for freedom  the United Nations providing a voice to the voiceless  A free South Africa has also been honoured by the declaration of  July as International Mandela Day  honouring our founding President and world icon  President Nelson Mandela  At this celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations I wish to extend  on behalf of the people of South Africa  our sincere gratitude to the world for its contribution to our freedom from the shackles of apartheid and institutionalized racism  The General Assembly continues to provide a voice for the voiceless and the oppressed  In an historic and landmark development the General Assembly approved a resolution to allow the Palestinian flag to fly in front of United Nations Headquarters  resolution     The resolution was passed by an overwhelming margin  supported by many nations from both the developed North and the developing South  There can be no peace  security and development in the Middle East without a resolution of the Palestinian question  A solution is urgent  Otherwise  if we delay  in the next decade we may no longer have a piece of land to justify the two State solution  The historic seventieth anniversary of the United Nations presents an opportunity to reflect on the structure and workings of the Organization  Significantly  this year marks the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the World Summit Outcome  resolution    in   which discussed reform of the United Nations  A number of significant decisions on reform have been successfully implemented since that Summit  They include the following  the replacement of the Human Rights Commission with a more effective Human Rights Council  the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission as a subsidiary body of both the General Assembly and the Security Council  the reform and streamlining of the United Nations management system  the mainstreaming of gender equality through the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  UNWomen  and the membershipdriven responsibility to protect and to assist populations facing genocide  crimes against humanity  war crimes and ethnic cleansing  We welcome that notable progress  However  almost no progress has been made on the commitment also made by Heads of State and Government in  to the early reform of the Security Council  It is unacceptable and unjustifiable that more than  billion people in the African continent are still excluded from permanent membership in the key decisionmaking structure of the United Nations  the Security Council  A continent with a smaller population than Africa is represented by three countries on the Security Council as permanent members  That is unfair  The United Nations cannot pretend that the world has not changed since   We are no longer colonies  We are free  independent sovereign States  We welcome the fact that the push for the reform of the Security Council coming from Africa has had an impact and has given some impetus to the intergovernmental negotiations process that has been looking at the reforms  We will continue working with progressive States towards the expansion of representation  Another critical matter that needs attention is the selection of the SecretaryGeneral  who is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council  A review of that process is necessary so as to enable more meaningful participation on the part of the General Assembly in the process  The President has identified human rights  governance  the rule of law  and the gender aspects of the work of the United Nations as important areas of focus for the seventieth session of the General Assembly  We have to build upon the initial work undertaken in the development of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in  to enhance protection in areas such as racism  discrimination against women and the promotion of the rights of the child and the rights of people with disabilities  We also believe that the United Nations human rights system  especially its Human Rights Council  should ensure a balance between civil and political rights  on the one hand  and economic  social and cultural rights  including the right to development  on the other  The Human Rights Council must also be seen as an independent and impartial mechanism for the entrenchment of a human rights culture throughout the world  It should avoid the pitfalls of its predecessor  the Commission on Human Rights  which was beset by politicization and was caught up in the divide between developed and developing countries  This year also marks  years since the adoption of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  The year  also marks  years since the adoption of the Freedom Charter in South Africa  which embodies the fundamental principles and values that are now enshrined in our Constitution  South Africa will continue to champion efforts in the United Nations human rights system to combat the scourges of racism  xenophobia  racial discrimination and related intolerances and to support work aimed at the promotion of substantive global equality  The seventieth general debate takes place in the context of growing international concern about the rise of violent extremism  terrorism and untold brutality  which we strongly condemn  We welcome the meetings that will take place on the margins of the General Assembly to review the progress made in countering terrorism in the Middle East and North Africa  We wish to emphasize that the Security Council must take into account the views of the African continent and its subregional organizations when dealing with conflicts in Africa in future  The current situation in Libya and the Sahel region is a direct consequence of the failure of some members of the Council to heed informed counsel from the African Union  The norm of responsibility to protect was abused for narrow political interests that had nothing to do with the fundamental aspects of the prevention of mass atrocities  The current refugee crisis in Europe is  sadly  the direct result of the militarization of civilian unrest  which included the massive arming of civilians and opposition groups in Libya  Syria and other affected countries  That kind of problem is a deliberately man made problem  and it is critical that  in discussing violent extremism and terrorism in parts of Africa and the Middle East  we look into the root causes of the problem and not just the symptoms  Also requiring our serious reflection is the regime change doctrine and its role in perpetuating conflicts and instability in various parts of our continent and the world  We welcome the recently signed peace agreement between the parties in South Sudan and urge the United Nations and all stakeholders to support the Sudanese people as they work to resolve their challenges  We reaffirm our support for the people of Western Sahara and urge the international community to encourage their struggle for selfdetermination  freedom  human rights and dignity  We also welcome the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States and the release of the Cuban Five  We reiterate our call for the lifting of the economic and financial embargo to help the Cuban people to gain their economic freedom  We acknowledge the contribution of His Holiness Pope Francis to the CubanUnited States normalization process  We also warmly welcome the contribution of the Holy Father generally to the global pursuit of peace  justice and the end of poverty and suffering  as eloquently expressed in the General Assembly and globally  We commend the United Nations for the key role that it has played in peacekeeping and urge that resources be prioritized for this core role of the United Nations  especially in Africa  The failure of the parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach an agreement at the  Review Conference   in the year that marks  years since the first atomic bombs were detonated in Japan   is a major setback to our commitment to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction  especially nuclear weapons  There can be no safe hands where nuclear weapons are concerned  The humanitarian consequences of a possible detonation of a nuclear weapon  whether intentional or accidental  will be catastrophic for humankind  We welcome the recent agreement reached on the Iranian nuclear programme and the recognition of the right of Iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy  The seventieth session of the General Assembly has seen the adoption of the post development agenda  The outcome document represents a victory for the developing world  as it affirms that the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  resolution    should build on the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals  Additionally  while the  Agenda is universal in its scope in that the Sustainable Development Goals adopted apply to both developed and developing countries  there is also a clear recognition of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities  The Agenda also contains a specific Goal on achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls  That is all the more appropriate given that this year is the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action and the fifteenth anniversary of Security Council resolution      on women  peace and security  As the initiator of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action   thanks to which the current round of negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC  is taking place   South Africa has a special interest in and commitment to the success of the Paris session of the Conference of the Parties later this year  We require the fulfilment of all three parts of the Durban mandate  namely  the closing of the current ambition gap in the pre period through the honouring of existing legal obligations by developed countries and enhanced action  the entry into force of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol  and the adoption in Paris of a new agreement for the post period that contains all the essential elements  including the means of implementation and the measures relating to loss  damage and response  We seek a fair  ambitious and legally binding agreement in Paris that is applicable to all parties  In addition  South Africa  as Chair of the G plus China  would not be able to accept a Paris package that is hollow or weak on finance  South Africa has submitted its intended nationally determined contribution to the UNFCCC secretariat ahead of the  October deadline  signalling our readiness for Paris  We join the world in celebrating the  years of existence of the United Nations  As we mark this historic anniversary  the reform of the Security Council and the strengthening of the General Assembly and other organs remain a paramount concern  By the end of this session  we should be in a position to adopt a road map  with clear and implementable time frames  on the priorities of this Organization as well as on its reform  We need to do this in order for the United Nations to remain a relevant force and a force for change in the world  In conclusion  let me express our deep appreciation of the offer made by China when it was addressing the Assembly  an offer that must go through the United Nations  China spelled out the support it intended to give to Africa  a total of  million of free military assistance to the African Union over the next five years to support the establishment of the African Standby Force and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises  We would like to underline our gratitude to China

election was described as transparent  peaceful  free and fair  reflecting our commitment to internationally accepted standards for peaceful changes of Government and popular participation in shaping a country s destiny  I would therefore like to thank the people of Zambia for being true champions of democracy  As we meet today  I also feel duty bound to thank the international community for its unflinching solidarity during that very challenging time of the past year  This year is an important one for the General Assembly  as we commemorate the  years of existence of the United Nations  In our deliberations  therefore  it is imperative that we take stock of the collective successes as well as the challenges of the past seven decades  in order to improve the performance of this noble Organization  I am optimistic that the seventieth session will set a tone for the future and meet the expectations of the international community as a whole  Zambia is proud to be part of the global endeavour to foster the mandate of the United Nations to promote peace  security and respect for human rights and to ensure progress in development for all  We are concerned  however  that the gears for advancing the three pillars of the Charter of the United Nations are moving at a very slow pace  which has the potential to negate the gains we have achieved so far  It is therefore important that we enhance our concerted efforts to address areas of concern  We have just adopted the world s quintessential development blueprint in the form of the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  resolution     centred on humankind  the environment and the creation of peaceful societies  Those core elements will guide its implementation  supported by the principle of leaving no one behind  I have been encouraged by the focus on development that has characterized the global discourse in recent years  as the  Agenda has evolved  The development lessons of the Millennium Development Goals and the cumulative experience of the  years of the United Nations should serve as a springboard for our ambitions  Let us therefore ensure the successful implementation and attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals  SDGs   I am confident that the invaluable lessons learned will set us on a trajectory that must inevitably lead to a safer  more inclusive  cleaner and more prosperous world  In the  years of the existence of the United Nations  the inequality gap among and between nations has continued to widen  as poverty and youth unemployment have threatened the prospects for peace  security and development  My Government looks forward to the comprehensive implementation of the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  which promotes poverty eradication and the creation of employment opportunities for young people and women  especially in rural communities  Over the past  years  the global community has become more united than ever before in its quest to push boundaries in order to attain peace and security  yet it is as divided as ever  if not more so  on the question of who makes decisions on global peace and security  The  years of the existence of the United Nations have seen more conflicts in Africa than on any other continent  and yet those  years have been characterized by Africa s absolute exclusion from decisionmaking in the Security Council  despite the fact that a significant part of the Council s agenda       A  PV  concerns the African continent  In the  years of the existence of the United Nations  Africa remains the only continent not represented among the permanent members of the Security Council  Goal  of the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  resolution    on reducing inequality among countries will not be achieved without eradicating the inequality among countries in the Security Council  The United Nations must  therefore  redouble its efforts to implement Security Council reform in order to ensure that Africa can take its rightful place among the community of nations and contributes equitably and effectively to global peace and security  Zambia has continued and will continue to offer its resources for peacekeeping  including the deployment earlier this year of a large contingent of troops to the Central African Republic  Zambia comes with a long history of involvement in conflict prevention  peacekeeping and peacebuilding  As a landlocked country  our independence was incomplete as long as we remained surrounded by nations still fighting their liberation struggles  That gave impetus to our moral conviction to join in the liberation struggles in Africa  Since then  Zambia has continued to participate in peacebuilding initiatives and has supported peacekeeping efforts all around the world  We continue to share the global concerns at the unrelenting threats of terrorism  as it mostly affects the safety of noncombatants and civilian populations  I have been encouraged by the focus on development that has characterized global discourse during the past year  notably through discussions on the SDGs and the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  Zambia has been a beneficiary of various initiatives aimed at facilitating the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals  which arose from the collective resolve of the generation of world leaders at the turn of the millennium  Indeed  most of our countries have continued to face serious challenges in the quest to foster development and improve the quality of life of our people  The challenges are numerous  including energy shortages and the effects of climate change  The two are inseparable on the development agenda for countries such as Zambia that rely heavily on hydropower generation  The changing rainfall pattern has adversely affected powergeneration capacities in most of our countries  This year  Zambia is experiencing an unprecedented energy crisis  which has already cost the nation dearly in terms of productivity  jobs and revenue  Beyond the economic limitations  the social ramifications are equally devastating to the country  It is therefore important that much effort be exerted to develop mitigation strategies to counter the effects of climate change  Furthermore  developing countries are still grappling with other challenges  such as poverty  high unemployment   particularly among the youth   skewed industrial development  low intraregional trade  inadequate infrastructure  low productivity in agriculture and livestock  poor quality health services and the challenges of access to quality education  As we move forward  it is important for us to acknowledge the realities and imperatives of the world today and to renew our common resolve to sustain the core principles of our Organization as the United Nations  We should redouble our efforts  by harnessing our individual strengths in order to collectively address the rather complex challenges that confront us in our increasingly globalized and interdependent world  Given the demographic nature of our communities  poverty remains a real concern  particularly in rural areas  In Zambia   per cent of the people in rural areas depend on agriculture for their livelihood  Agriculture is one of my Government s priority areas in the county s efforts to diversify the economy  apart from mining  The Government is therefore devising interventions aimed at improving capacities and adding value for both subsistence farmers and commercial farmers  Our interventions  notably the Farmer Input Support Programme  the Irrigation Development and Support Project  and other credit schemes  need additional support in order to exploit the full potential of that giant industry  We also seek to strengthen partnerships to enable the improvement of services in such areas as providing extension services  improving access to market information and facilitating the physical transfer of produce to markets  A key element of Zambia s development agenda is industrialization  In that regard  my Government has devised measures to encourage and support the development of appropriate industries  mainly in valueadded industries  in order to spur structural economic transformation and increase privatesector participation  The primary focus in that area has been on areas with more backward and forward linkages so as to catapult the Zambian economy to higher levels of growth  leveraging regional value chains so as to    A  PV     expand trade  attract foreign direct investment  create employment  reduce poverty  promote sustainable development and thereby empower our people  Financing is one of the major challenges that faces developing countries  We need external resources to bridge the gap in the funds required to finance development projects  It is in that light that the United Nations third International Conference on Financing for Development  held in Addis Ababa in July to develop strategies for financing development  was most welcome  The Conference recommended several measures meant to bridge the financing gap  including the need to exploit new sources of finance and improve tax administration systems  which would be supplemented by international support  We know that putting the appropriate infrastructure in place is very important in our quest to expand intraAfrica trade  bolster our productive capacities and enhance Africa s competitiveness in the global market  In that regard  we must quickly identify sources to raise the  billion Africa needs annually to finance its infrastructure development  It is equally important  from the perspective of landlocked developing countries  to remain committed to implementing the decisions of the  Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade   In keeping with that commitment  Zambia was privileged to host a highlevel meeting on the followup to the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries  held in Livingstone in June  I was honoured to officiate at the Conference and hope that the Assembly finds the time to review the outcome document  entitled  Livingstone Call for Action   Special attention should be paid to gender and women s empowerment  The International Conference on Population and Development Beyond  Global Review Report  published in June   indicates that  per cent of women have been victims of gender based violence  Indeed  Zambia acknowledges that the problem extends to most nations  including our own  To that end  we are already implementing important interventions to curb that scourge  Our approach to development will not be limited to the economy but will continue to focus on all pillars of development  I welcome the fact that our traditional leaders  the United Nations system and civil society have all been seamlessly working with Governments in fighting for gender equality for our women and girls  One of the most important programmes  and one in which I have been engaged as a designated champion  is the  He For She  campaign  which seeks to address issues of genderbased violence  That project was initiated by UNWomen in September  with the aim of addressing incidents of genderbased violence  In a few days  my Government will also launch the United Statessupported  From Boys to Men  project  which targets the toyearold age group and is aimed at encouraging the development of a nonviolent generation  In our determination to bridge the gap between the sexes  a vigorous campaign is under way to strengthen the education of girls by encouraging them to complete their schooling and unlock their developmental potential instead of being pushed into child  early or forced marriages  The situation of our young people remains daunting  with unemployment one of the major challenges they face  To address that situation  my Government recently launched a national youth policy that seeks to lay a foundation for interventions of various kinds aimed at supporting the development of a vibrant and productive generation  We hope to create   jobs over the next five years  an effort that will depend heavily on the privatesectorled job market  We are also making efforts to address the specific social disadvantages of the most marginalized members of our society  including the disabled  We want to ensure that they can realize their potential and serve in national development efforts in the same way as anyone else  The challenges are many  but they are not insurmountable  The United Nations has been a key ally in addressing some of those problems  and indeed  to a large extent  the story of Zambia is the story of the United Nations  I am confident that through our concerted and collective efforts  determination and hard work  coupled with able and visionary leadership  we shall indeed overcome  I look forward to working with everyone here so as to ensure that our shared solutions are brought forward and implemented in the spirit of this Organization

       "7506  Allow me at the outset to extend to Mr  Mogens Lykketoft my warm congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session  He assumes this office at an historic moment when the United Nations has just adopted an ambitious agenda for the future of humankind  The task ahead needs all hands on deck and he can count on our cooperation and support during his presidency  I wish to commend Mr  Sam Kutesa  a distinguished son of Africa  for the dynamism with which he steered this body over the past year  We particularly appreciated his leadership in promoting inclusive dialogue and seeking consensus on the many sensitive issues that he presided over during his tenure of office  The theme of this session    The United Nations at   the road ahead for peace  security and human rights    aptly complements the deliberations of the Summit meeting on the post development agenda  It is our expectation that the United Nations will draw from its seven decades of experiences to give birth to a new era of peace  equality and justice  a new era that recognizes and fosters the commonality of our common fate through renewed international cooperation and solidarity  The African Union welcomes the priorities the President has proposed  for they go in tandem with our own development plan  the Agenda   which recognizes the intrinsic and inextricable linkages between peace  security  development and the full realization of human rights  The African Union Constitutive Act recognizes that while peace and security are imperative for our progress  conflict is a major impediment to the socio economic advancement and integration of the continent  Consequently  the Common African Position on the post development agenda designates peace and security as one of its six key pillars  It is a top priority for us  The prevalence of peace not only creates conditions conducive to development  but also ensures that the maximum possible resources can be dedicated to development programmes and projects  We welcome and encourage the continued cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union  principally through the latter s Peace and Security Council  in advancing peace and security in Africa  In January  the leaders of the African Union adopted Agenda  as our continent s plan to accelerate deepened economic integration of our countries and regions  Its main objective is to improve the well being of the continent s citizenry through sustained and balanced economic growth  At the African Union Summit in Pretoria  South Africa  in June this year we agreed on the Agenda s first year development plan  During these initial  years  the flagship programmes will include the creation of a continental freetrade area  an African centre for disease control  a panAfrica university of science and technology to develop skills for the value addition and beneficiation of the continent s vast mineral resources  a single aviation market  a highspeed train  and a panAfrican enetwork  The successful implementation of Agenda  calls not just for the commitment of African stakeholders but also for the support and engagement of partners beyond the borders of our continent  Africa is not looking for handouts  Rather it is looking for partners in massive infrastructure development  in creating and exploiting the value chains from its Godgiven natural resources  and in improving the quality of life of the continent s citizens  The entire world stands to benefit more from an economically empowered African continent than from one emasculated by deprivation and with an over dependence on others  Adaptation to change is the most crucial ingredient for the vibrancy and effectiveness of any organization  including the United Nations  While the world has drastically changed since   the United Nations  and indeed the global governance architecture  remains mired in a long bygone era  This archaic hierarchy among nations threatens to erode the confidence and support that the United Nations commands among the majority  but disadvantaged  of its membership  We are disappointed that we have lost the opportunity of this anniversary to address this burning issue of Security Council reform in a manner that satisfies the just demands and expectations of the majority among us  I wish to reiterate our strong attachment to Africa s common position on Security Council reform contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration  I call on all genuine friends of Africa and all those who value justice  fairness and democracy to support Africa s just and reasonable proposals  We equally call for the revitalization of the General Assembly  the sole universally representative and democratic organ of the United Nations  so that it can effectively carry out its Chartermandated responsibilities  Accordingly  we fully support the call for inclusivity and transparency in selecting our Organization s SecretaryGeneral by ensuring that the General Assembly plays a more significant role in that process  After all  the SecretaryGeneral is at the service of all the Member States  and not only that of an exclusive  privileged few  Respecting and upholding human rights is the obligation of all States and is enshrined in the United Nations Charter  Nowhere does the Charter arrogate the right to some to sit in judgement over others in carrying out this universal obligation  In that regard  we reject the politicization of this important issue and the application of double standards to victimize those who dare think and act independently of the selfanointed prefects of our time  We equally reject attempts to prescribe new rights that are contrary to our values  norms  traditions and beliefs  We are not gays  Cooperation and respect for each other will advance the cause of human rights worldwide  confrontation  vilification and double standards will not  Selfdetermination and independence are intrinsic and fundamental rights that should be enjoyed by all peoples everywhere  without distinction  We are deeply concerned by the continued denial of this basic right to the Saharan people  We urge the United Nations to expeditiously finalize what must be done to conclude the decolonization of the Western Sahara  In the Middle East  the suffering of the Palestinian people continues unabated  What does Mr  Obama say about that  We reiterate our unwavering support for the just cause of the Palestinian people  Do we agree  Mr  United States  We also reiterate that lasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved only through negotiations to achieve a twoState solution based on the pre borders  We are concerned at the increase in tensions in that region and urge the United Nations to assume its responsibility and bring an end to this senseless conflict  The promotion of gender equality is critical for the realization of the post development agenda  The African Union has designated  as the Year of Women s Empowerment and Development towards Agenda  in order to mobilize our individual and collective actions around this key issue  Gender equality and women s empowerment are central to the achievement of human development  progress and the elimination of the scourge of poverty and deprivation  We must continue to build upon the achievements that have been realized since the  Fourth World Conference on Women and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action  The growing list of phenomena that neither respect nor know any borders makes it imperative that we mobilize all mechanisms for cooperation to effectively overcome them  Terrorism and extremist violence  communicable diseases such as HIV and AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria  bird flu  and Ebola cannot be overcome singlehandedly  The United Nations and its specialized agencies are the place and the mechanism for this indispensable and necessary cooperation  For some months now  we have watched heartbreaking and harrowing scenes of desperate refugees seeking to enter Europe in search of safety and shelter from the ravages of conflict in their own homelands  We have also read of the tragedy and loss of life in the Mediterranean  The majority of the affected people are from Syria or from other countries devastated by conflict and instability  induced in great part by the destabilizing policies of external forces  This tragic situation could have been avoided through respect for the independence of other countries and noninterference in their internal affairs  In the case of Libya  we are witnessing the results of abusing the authority of the Security Council and ignoring the opinion of regional organizations  in this instance the African Union  that are supposed to be the partners of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security  My country  Zimbabwe  is committed to a fair  just and effective United Nations in which multilateralism  inclusivity and transparency replace unilateralism  exclusion and backroom deals  The Charter of the United Nations is built on the bedrock of the sovereign equality and independence of its Members  without distinction as to their geographical size  economic might or any other endowments or qualifications  We are deeply attached to these principles and call on other Members of the United Nations to be similarly disposed  The United Nations was set up  among other purposes  to  develop friendly relations among nations   Zimbabwe desires and is committed to nurturing friendly relations with other nations  but it cannot tolerate interference in its domestic affairs  We invite other countries with which we may have differences of whatever nature   including the United States and the NATO Powers   to eschew threats  pressures and punitive actions in favour of reconciliation  friendship and dialogue  I therefore denounce in the strongest terms the illegal sanctions that are imposed on my country by the European Union and the United States of America and call for their immediate and unconditional removal  We do not know what wrong we have done to the United States  I would kindly ask it to leave us free and independent to do our own thing  Once more  I put on record that my country is desirous to live in harmony with all countries big and small  We have peace in Zimbabwe just now  We do not want war  We do not want interference  We do not want to hear of regime change at all  The seventieth anniversary of our Organization has been marked by the adoption of a farreaching Agenda that has the potential to drastically transform our world in all aspects  We are under no illusion about the challenges that lie ahead  but we are not discouraged  either  Humankind has  over the epochs  demonstrated an immense tenacity in overcoming inertia and resistance to change  Now is our time to leave our own positive mark on the history of human development and interaction  Posterity expects no less from us



       "0     may I first convey to our President the congratulation of the albanian delegation on his election to the Presidency of the twentyfifth session of the General Assembly     in take up the work on the agenda of the twenty fifth session of the General Assembly   which be be hold on the eve of the twentyfifth anniversary of the come into force of the Charter of the United Nations   the peacelove Member States would have wish to be in a position to present on this occasion some picture of positive and satisfactory activity on the part of the United Nations   the albanian delegation   for its part   would have take great pleasure in draw up such a balance sheet of activity cover a quarter of a century   which be certainly no short period in the life of an international organization   unfortunately   this be not the situation   create on the day after victory have be achieve over the Powers of the Rome BerlinTokyo Axis and conceive in the spirit of the principle which predominate in the war of the antifascist coalition   the Organization awaken in the whole of progressive humanity the hope that it would serve as an important factor in create well international condition in order to favor the cause of freedom   peace and world security   but its activity and a number of event which occur in the world arena during that period disappoint the hope of people   the United Nations   far from having contribute   as require by the fundamental provision of the Charter   to the consolidation of international peace and security and the liberation struggle of people   have on the contrary   under the diktat of the imperialist power   the United States of America foremost among they   embark on a path diametrically oppose to those principle   and have serve as an instrument favor their policy of pillage   oppression and aggression against peacelove people and country     the utilization of the United Nations to serve this policy have result in the Organization not only not having be able to stay the hand of those commit aggression in many part of the world   but having frequently help the aggressor   its activity in this direction go so far   moreover   that under the flag of the United Nations there have be perpetrate some of the most barbarous aggression experience since the end of the Second World War   such as   among other   the armed aggression in Korea and in the Congo     the whole of progressive mankind recall with admiration the heroic struggle which   under the direction of the great Stalin   the Soviet Union wage   in cooperation with the AngloAmerican coalition   to defend the peaceful people and country against Hitlerite Germany   the historic and decisive victory of the Red Army over the Nazi horde and the great role play by the Soviet Union during the Second World War arouse great enthusiasm among people and awaken in they the hope for a well future   they follow with great interest and with particular joy the unflinche struggle which be wage by the Leninist Soviet Union in the world arena   as well as by its authentic representative here in this Organization   in order to defend their vital interest and to sustain their legitimate struggle for liberation from the imperialist   colonialist and racist yoke   but follow the usurpation of power in that country by the Khrushchev clique   the situation change completely   and the struggle of the Soviet Union against american imperialism and its ally be replace by the holy alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States against the peacelove and freedomlove people and country   it be thus that   so far as the United Nations be concern   it have become a center of bargaining   maneuvering and underhand manipulation on the part of the american imperialist and the soviet socialimperialist   design to lull the vigilance of people and to disguise as well they can their policy of world hegemony     all this have have well know consequence for the United Nations   which have be particularly damaging to its authority and its ability to play the part which be incumbent upon it under the Charter   but   at the same time   this negative activity have help people to realize well the nature of the two imperialist Powers and what can be expect from the United Nations in the present circumstance where it be be manipulate by those two Powers   it have   in particular   become obvious to they that all the initiative and proposal of american governing circle and of Moscow revisionist in connexion with disarmament and all the agreement which they seek to impose on other state in this field   with respect to both conventional armament and nuclear armament   be design solely to disarm peaceloving country and to ensure for themselves the nuclear monopoly and the large possible quantity of armament of all sort in order to subjugate people and to enslave the world which they wish to divide between they   Peoples be become more aware than ever that the only way for they to break free from every imperialist   colonialist and racist yoke be through armed struggle and trust in their own strength   while at the same time enjoy the solidarity and the support of all other freedomlove people and country     one of the undeniable proof that the United Nations have embark on the road of violate the principle and spirit of the Charter be the withholding for   year of the legitimate right of the People s Republic of China in this Organization   a circumstance which not only have bring about an abnormal situation without precedent in this Organization and constitute a severe blow to its prestige   but also have at the same time affect its capacity regard the contribution which it should make to the settlement of the important problem of our time   none of which   as we well know   can be give a real solution without the participation of the great socialist China of   million people     undoubtedly   such a state of affair in this Organization do not discourage the Member States who espouse the fundamental principle of the Charter   on the contrary   trust in their own strength and their own possibility and encourage by the development and the victory of the liberation struggle wage by people in all continent   they will redouble their effort and cooperate more closely in order to wage a more effective battle against the policy of diktat and force which have be practice by the two great imperialist power here in the United Nations or elsewhere in the world     the liberation movement at the world level against the imperialist and colonialist Powers be at present make new stride   the people have react to the policy of oppression and domination practice by the imperialist Powers and their aggression and plot   by strengthen their just struggle for independence and freedom and join the rank of the armed struggle against the aggressor   this be show by the struggle of the heroic people of VietNam   Laos   Cambodia and other country of IndoChina   the straggle of the people of Korea and other people of the Far East against the United States imperialist   their ally and their tool   the struggle of the valiant Palestinians and other arab people against imperialistzionist aggression   the struggle of the people of Oman and Dhofar and the people of the Arabian Gulf to free themselves from the colonial yoke   the resistance of the people of Eastern Europe against the domination of the new imperialist of the Kremlin   the struggle of the african people of Mozambique   Angola   Guinea   Bissau    Namibia   Southern Rhodesia and South Africa against the colonial Powers   the settler and their racist tool   the struggle of the people of Puerto Rico to free themselves from the imperialist yoke of the United States   as well as all those struggle that be be wage by people in various part of the world   include that of the american people in the very citadel of imperialism   the imperialist Powers and their ally be suffer defeat after defeat   powerful blow have be strike against they everywhere by the people that be struggle for their national independence   for their freedom and for their sacred and inalienable right to be master of their own destiny     Panicstricken at the impetuous growth of the revolutionary struggle for the liberation of people and assail by multiple internal and external difficulty   the two socalled superpower   american imperialism and soviet socialimperialism   which be at the head of all reactionary force   be strive you all mean in their power to face up to this desperate situation and to accelerate the implementation of their aggressive and warlike plan against peacelove people and country   these two power have during this period intensify their collusion and their criminal activity   use deceit and demagogy as well as various form of pressure   force and armed aggression     although split by numerous contradiction derive from their imperialist nature   each try to undermine the other and to evict the other from its political   economic and strategic position   these two superpower have a common hatred for the freedom of people and the socialist revolution   it be on that basis that rest their cooperation and their aggressive activity   their plan and their plot   which extend to all continent in conformity with their global counterrevolutionary strategy   which be design to divide and dominate the world   the Glasborough policy be pursue uninterruptedly   and AmericanSoviet collusion have take fresh step forward   under the guise of peaceful slogan for the   peaceful settlement   of conflict which have be bring about precisely by the aggression which they themselves have perpetrate or direct   for european   asian or international   security   which be in fact nothing but the security of the imperialist order for disarmament   for   internationalism   which presuppose   limited sovereignty    or more exactly the subjugation of people and nation   as well as other slogan   they plot and they coordinate their position and their activity regard various problem which affect the interest of mankind as a whole   use such slogan   they be hatch plan and try to impose socalled peaceful settlement by mean of which they be try to repress the liberation struggle wage by people   they be conclude treaty which be both fraudulent and enslaving and they be try to conclude new aggressive pact which will be add to the pact   bloc and military basis that be now in existence   they be exert pressure of all sort on the freedomlove people and country that dare to resist they   they be carry on the arm race and the preparation for a new war   they indulge in nuclear blackmail and fresh act of aggression     in that connexion we can cite   simultaneously with the secret negotiation of the two Powers through diplomatic channel   the long meeting of their representative in Helsinki and later in Vienna   meeting which certainly be not limit to the question of the   limitation of strategic arm    the socalle Rogers plan for a   peaceful settlement   of the Middle East problem   a plan which be the result of the american soviet plot design to stifle the legitimate liberation struggle of the palestinian people and other arab people   which be at the origin of the bloody event which have take place recently in Jordan   of a similar nature be the negotiation between the United States and the Soviet Union on IndoChina and the meeting organize in Moscow and elsewhere with representative of the reactionary regime in Asia to bring about a   peaceful settlement   of that problem a settlement which they believe will lead to the capitulation of the people of VietNam   Laos and Cambodia the travel of high emissary of those two power in Asia and their effort to create there new aggressive pact in accordance with the Brezhnev plan for the   collective security of Asia   and the Nixon plan to pit Asiatics against Asiatics   plan which have be concert between those two power and be design first and foremost to create a circle of fire around the People s Republic of China   in the same category we should mention the enslaving SovietCzechoslovak treaty as well as the MoscowBonn treaty   which among other thing trample under foot the sovereign right of the german people of the Democratic Republic of Germany and which   together with the SovietAmerican project on socalle european security   relate to the sphere of influence of the two power in Europe and their rearguard activity on that continent in order to implement their counterrevolutionary plan in Asia   Africa and elsewhere     in order to bring about this great antipopular conspiracy   the american and soviet imperialist be apply a series of political   economic and military measure   such as intensify the imperialist american aggression in Laos and the new aggression against Cambodia   plot and wile design to divide the arab people and country and plunge they into bloody and fratricidal conflict and to repress you all mean possible   include armed force   the legitimate struggle of the heroic people of Palestine   of a similar nature also be the threat and the measure take by the soviet revisionist against the people of eastern european country   include the military maneuver of soviet occupation force in Czechoslovakia   carry out last August to intimidate the people on the eve of the second anniversary of the soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia     thus the two Powers stop at nothing to realize their imperialist plan to stifle the revolutionary struggle of peacelove people and country   to establish their domination of the world and to arrogate to themselves the role of international police in order to decide in their own good time the fate of humanity     however   those be castle in the air   the wheel of history can not be turn backwards   the era when the fate of people and of small country be decide by the great imperialist power have go for ever   the more the imperialist intensify their aggressive activity   the more the people strengthen their own struggle and the more the people strengthen their own struggle and the more closely they become united in the vast front of the armed struggle against the common enemy   never will the people renounce their legitimate struggle to win back their vital right   despite temporary vicissitude   their struggle be on the whole increase and be strengthen and it appear now more than   ever before that a storm of liberation be break throughout Asia   Africa and elsewhere   a storm which will completely annihilate   in spite of underhanded maneuver and repression   imperialist and colonialist domination in whatever form it may exist     a recent example which be the good illustration of what await the american imperialist and their policy of intervention and war be the armed aggression they perpetrate against Cambodia last March   immediately after the coup d etat which they plot in that country   face with an impasse because of the blow mete out in the struggle of the vietnamese people   the american aggressor send their troop to Cambodia in order to implement there the   Nixon doctrine    which be design to pit IndoChinese against IndoChinese   but this aggression   far from lead to the expect result   immediately meet with the armed resistance of the people of Cambodia and the military solidarity of their vietnamese and laotian brother   powerfully support by the great chinese people as well as by the other people of Asia   it arouse energetic opposition on the part of people throughout the world   include the american people   instead of stifle the liberation struggle of the vietnamese people   the aggression against Cambodia have spread throughout IndoChina the fire of the liberation and revolutionary struggle and have open an even wide and deep abyss   where american imperialism will finally be engulf without any hope of be rescue     the success gain by the cambodian people   under the leadership of the United Front of Cambodia   preside over by the Head of State   Samdech Norodom Sihanouk   in liberate a large part of the national territory from the aggressor and their lackey   and the solidarity and new consolidation of the unity of the people of Cambodia   VietNam   Laos   the People s Republic of China   and the Democratic People s Republic of Korea   as well as of other revolutionary people in Asia   constitute a harsh blow to american imperialism   its collaborator and its lackey     the american aggression against Cambodia be at the same time further proof of the collusion   at the expense of the people   of american imperialism with the revisionist of Moscow   the latter having adopt for this occasion an attitude similar to that of the American Government towards their aggression in Czechoslovakia   in particular   their refusal to recognize the Government of the United Front of Cambodia and the fact that they maintain normal diplomatic relation with the Lon Nol clique   an instrument of american imperialism support by the puppet in Saigon and Seoul and even by the riffraff of Chiang Kaishek   as well as by international reaction as a whole   have once again reveal to world public opinion the true way with the camp of imperialism and reaction     the event of the current year in Cambodia and throughout IndoChina be of great importance for the indochinese people   which not only now have fresh proof of the obstinacy of american imperialism in carry out act of aggression and extend the war   but also now be in a well position to decide who be sincerely against the Yankee invader and who be with he   what the soviet socialimperialist be and what great socialist China represent for they   thus they realize once again that armed struggle be the only way to become free of the american aggressor     despite the intensification of the effort of the american imperialist   back up by the soviet revisionist   the valiant people of VietNam have thwart all the plan and dangerous subterfuge design to bring about its capitulation   throughout South VietNam the people and its popular liberation army have take up arm and strike crush blow against the american aggressor   without give they a moment of respite even in their military camp and basis   such as Da Nang   Ben Tre   Hue   the outskirt of Saigon and other part of the country   the vietnamese people and its armed force have   through their brilliant victory   tie down the american imperialist and their Saigon tool on the battlefield   these victory have show undeniably that the effort of the Yankee aggressor to escape inevitable defeat by extend the war have bring they only far irreparable reversal   the long revolutionary struggle have temper the vietnamese people and have make it invincible   and by its determined and heroic struggle it will undoubtedly deal ever more crush blow at american imperialism until it be completely defeat     the armed struggle for the national wellbeing of the people   of VietNam   Laos and Cambodia be constantly develop and be reinforce   it be now in a new stage   all the criminal plot which the american and soviet imperialist have hatch in order to bring about a socalled peaceful settlement in IndoChina be doom to complete failure   american imperialism be surround and defeat on all front   it be bind to be beat     a typical case which show the ferocity of the great AmericanSoviet conspiracy and the method of combine the most diverse mean of action on the part of these imperialist power in order to carry out their policy of aggression and hegemony be the tragic and serious situation which prevail at the present time in the Near East   concern with implement at all cost their common plan of sad repute baptize the Rogers plan design to liquidate the palestinian question and to divide the arab people   to legalize and to reward the imperialistisraeli aggression and to assure their imperialist interest in that area   the United States and the revisionist Soviet Union have plot and put into effect the criminal collusion design to stifle the palestinian liberation movement through the reactionary regime of Jordan   thus try to implement in the Near East the Nixon doctrine aim at pit Asians against Asians   thus jordanian reaction   serve american imperialism and Zionism   have use fire and sword   cannon   tank and aviation against the heroic palestinian fighter   barbarous mass massacre have be perpetrate against the palestinian population in Amman and elsewhere   at the same time   american imperialism   by statement from Nixon   Laird and other leader   threaten to intervene in the internal affair of the arab country and also threaten intervention by its Sixth Fleet   thus try   as always   to play the role of international policeman to oppress people and suppress liberation struggle   to defend those clique which be in their pocket   to defend their rapacious interest and to enslave people     american imperialism and world reaction consider as unfair the fraternal assistance give by Syria and Iraq to their arab brother who be struggle for a just cause   for their common cause   accord to their logic they have the right and the freedom to intervene in all country   everywhere   they can utilize tank   cannon   and their war fleet to oppress and exploit the people of other country   whereas Syria and Iraq be not entitle to come to the aid of their brother     a wave of indignation and resentment have be unleash throughout the progressive world   quite rightly   the conscience of the arab people have revolt against the treachery of the rule clique in Jordan   and the world wonder   why be tank and bullet be use against the Palestinians   be it because they be struggle for their liberty   for independence and for their sacred land     the people of all continent   profoundly indignant   be raise their voice in protest against the american imperialist and the soviet socio imperialist   they be cry    Hands off the palestinian people   Jordan   Syria and the other arab country      it be quite clear that the Palestinians be not obey the   Rogers plan    they know full well that the american plan which be base on the Security Council resolution of   November   which   as we know   be itself the result of bargaining in the corridor between the Americans and the Soviets be design   inter alia   to impose the elimination of the palestinian question and the recognition of Israel s right to annex part of the territory which it invade follow its aggression of   June    this plan be also design to reward the zionist aggression by guarantee the existence of the State of Israel   which have take over arab territory which be also conquer by aggression   and also by recognize other right   still bad   the two   superpower   want to use the new ceasefire to continue the maneuver and machination which they have engage in for the past three year in order once again to apply the tactic use by the imperialist power after the israeli aggression of    with the aim of put off for ever the fulfillment of the sacred cause of the Arabs and thus make a fait accompli out of Israel s new occupation of their territory     no   the arab people will never accept the United StatesSoviet diktat   which be design to bring about their recapitulation   the palestinian people and the other arab people have reject this plot   the effort of the United States imperialist and the soviet revisionist be in vain   the arab people have a long experience   and they well know the israeli aggressor and their master   never will they allow the two foreign power to decide their fate   whatever be their machination and their sharing of role   one present itself as the author of the criminal plan and the other giving that plan its support     the arab people know full well that any proposal by the United States of America   which incite and assist Israel to unleash aggression three year ago and which continue to provide Israel with armament and encourage it to pursue its aggression and provocation   be design simply to serve the imperialist interest of that power in the area of the Near East   which be of great strategic importance and be rich in petroleum deposit   as well as the interest of Israel   its instrument   it be obvious and no one could deny it that without the assistance and support of the United States Israel would never have be in a position to initiate the aggression of June    and even less to continue to occupy the arab territory     with regard to the soviet revisionist   whatever mask they may put on   the arab people know their face   especially since the AmericanIsraeli aggression   and they be convinced that what they be interested in be penetrate into the Near East and the Mediterranean Basin and create condition favorable for their expansion in that area     the leader of the albanian people   Comrade Enver Hoxha   refer to this problem in his statement of   September to the elector of Tirana   say   among other thing    in the final analysis   the glorious revolutionary arab people will not have the wool pull over their eye by the false friendship of soviet social imperialism   which have take advantage of their temporary difficulty to occupy their port and their sea and to stifle their just liberation struggle against the Fascist Zionists and the United States imperialist   the two aggressive imperialist power be interested in plant their root deep in the Near East and in ensure that they have economic   political and military basis in the country of the area   they want to oppress the people of those country   lull they with word   demoralize they and corrupt they in order   finally   by the use of those basis   to go even far and invade Africa   Asia and other region   start colonial war and plunder various continent    the albanian people love the arab people   because they be their brother and their friend in good time and in bad   at this time of revolutionary and liberation struggle   we be at their side constantly   we have support they and will continue to support they with all the mean at our disposal   we have confidence in the triumph of the just cause for which they be fight   but   in order to win an early victory over the common enemy   a unity that be hard as steel must be forge among all the arab people in the armed struggle   the Zionists   the United States imperialist and the soviet revisionist be seek to divide the arab people   to disarm they   to impose on they a peace that will be not theirs but their enemy    the arm that have be supply to they be control by the Soviets   they have not be make available for the sacred arab cause   but they be be use precisely to deceive the Arabs   to tie their hand and send they to the slaughterhouse   the   Rogers plan   of ill repute could more accurately be call the   RogersGromyko plan    the arab people will certainly never fall into the terrible trap of that plan   the SovietUnited States army can   by recourse to various insidious mean   succeed in establish themselves on both side of the Suez Canal   in which case one may wonder what purpose the hardware supply to the Arabs by the Soviets would serve   they have not heroically drive one imperialist from the Canal only to see it occupy now by two other    the clamoring of day an be in harmony with the secret maneuver of the soviet revisionist   but the crackling of the heroic gun of the arab palestinian brother be the most glorious reply   which will put down this great conspiracy of their enemy   therefore   you all possible mean   we must resolutely assist the partisan struggle of the Palestinians   a struggle that be now in the forefront of the more general battle which must be wage by arab people on all front   our arab brother will succeed in raise high the banner of the liberation struggle against the imperialist and Zionists   they will reduce to nothing the plan of the soviet revisionist and all the provocation organize by the agency of the CIA which be conspire against the liberation struggle of the people of Palestine and all the arab people      the arab people have great revolutionary tradition and be know for their bravery and their liberation struggle   they know that they be not fight against the israeli aggressor only   but also against the two imperialist power which be mainly responsible for the situation in the Near East and   therefore   they will not allow themselves to fall into the trap of those power     the event of recent day in Jordan have confirm that   as the leader of the albanian people   Comrade Enver Hoxha   indicate in his statement of   September   soviet socialimperialism be pursue aim that have nothing in common with the interest of the arab people   as on other occasion   they be not at all concerned with the fate of the arab people   their sole aim be to consolidate their imperialist position   in this particular case   the soviet revisionist leader   reply to Nixon s appeal to bring in Moscow s fire brigade to snuff out the revolutionary struggle of the Palestinians and other arab people   to subjugate and enslave they   hasten to assume the role of fireman   through their official declaration and propaganda organ   they come to the defense of the clique in power in Jordan   threaten the Palestinians with the slogan   violence lead to violence    and address appeal to they and other arab people ask they to give up their struggle   all those fact have serve to make even more obvious to the arab people the perfidious role be play by the social imperialist of Moscow and the real aim of the United StatesSoviet plan for the Near East     the Palestinians consider Jordan as their second homeland   they be not the cause of disruption in Jordan   rather   the fault lie with the reactionary regime in Jordan and King Hussein   who be in the service of United States imperialism and the   Rogers plan    on the contrary   the Palestinians in Jordan be the healthy element in the common struggle to annihilate the common enemy     the albanian people be profoundly indignant   strongly condemn those criminal act and support the heroic struggle of the Palestinians who be fight for their sacred right   we be convince that   thank to their resolute struggle and the strengthening of their unity in combat   and enjoy the support of their true friend   of all freedomlove people   they will expose the plot of their enemy and gain final victory over the aggressor     in the dealing between the United States and the Soviet Union   an important place be hold also by the socalled question of the european security conference   propose last year by the Kremlin leader through their instrument of aggression   the Warsaw Treaty   there have be sign of intense activity this year   at the instigation of the two Powers   in accordance with their strategy to consolidate and subsequently extend their domination in Europe and carry out their aggressive plan in other area   United States and soviet imperialist be particularly concerned with ensure the success of that project   the soviet revisionist in particular be show special haste   which can be explain by their internal difficulty   the ever grow resistance of the country of Eastern Europe to their policy of intervention and domination   by their plan and preparation for aggression direct towards Asia against the People s Republic of China   of course the United States and its West em ally   particularly the Federal Republic of Germany   have not fail to do everything in their power to exploit this haste display by the soviet revisionist leadership   in order to obtain the large possible number of concession on the german problem and that of West Berlin   as well as to ensure their economic   political and cultural penetration into the country of Eastern Europe     confront by the insurmountable difficulty relate to the contradiction exist on many problem between the United States imperialist and the soviet social imperialist as well as between they and the other European States   the two so call superpower   in order to find a way out and mislead public opinion   have hit on the following formula to serve as a guide principle for any agreement to be conclude in this framework    renunciation of the use of force in relation among the States of Europe    that misleading formula be design in fact to give they something to cling to as they conclude these agreement   it be on the basis of that formula that the negotiation take place between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and Poland   as well as the long negotiation   of paramount importance   between the Soviet Union and West Germany     in all those activity the step which have have the great impact be the SovietWest German Treaty sign on   August last in Moscow   intense propaganda attend the signing of that treaty which be design to present it as a historic event that would so they say bring peace to Europe and the integrity of its border   of course   such a campaign   regardless of the mean use   could deceive only the naive   the people of Europe   who have have great experience   can not be take in by empty rhetoric   in particular   the propaganda statement of the soviet and american leader   and their supporter   can not fail to recall the vast deceitful campaign which accompany the various stage of the plotting and compromise of the Western Powers with hitlerian militarism   especially as regard the Munich Agreement of September      the Moscow Treaty be in fact no solution to the german problem   indeed it be an open violation of the decision on that problem adopt by the Allied Powers during the war   and of the oft renew promise of the soviet revisionist leadership to conclude a peace treaty with the two german States   or simply with the German Democratic Republic   and to defend the interest and sovereign right of the latter   the soviet revisionist have trample under foot their commitment and their obligation   and thus commit a serious crime against the german people   against the German Democratic Republic   against peace and security in Europe and in the entire world   they have therefore assume a heavy responsibility     the Moscow Treaty be in fact formal recognition of the entry of conquer Germany into the community of States   without their having sign a peace treaty   in the SovietGerman Treaty   apart from a few equivocal and questionable term   there be no reference to recognition of border between the two german States and the OderNeisse line divide Poland and the German Democratic Republic as final and unchangeable border   nor be there recognition by the Federal Republic of Germany of the German Democratic Republic as an independent   sovereign State fully you all international right   even more important   the Chancellor of West Germany and the other leader in Bonn have state on more than one occasion   both before and after the signing of the Treaty   that they will never give up the idea of the reunification of the german nation   which to they mean annexation of the German Democratic Republic   that position be again confirm in the document annex to the Treaty   the Bonn Government thus be endeavor to make the most out of this situation and to gain time in order to prepare to attain its   expansionist objective in the most favorable circumstance   thus   the soviet revisionist have consider and use the German Democratic Republic as a bargaining counter in their dealing with the revengeseeker in Bonn   who still claim they have the right to speak and act on behalf of all of Germany   and there they be support by the great Western power     as for the provision of the Treaty concern the renunciation of the use of force or the inviolability of border   not only do this not mean that the border be in fact unchangeable   but the people of Europe know full well the value of such commitment on the part of the german revengeseeker   for the memory of Hitler s nonaggression pact with European States be still very fresh in their mind     therefore   from all point of view   the Moscow Treaty undeniably provide Bonn s leader with something to fall back on   it encourage their expansionist and revengeseeke plan and be at the same time a serious blow to the German Democratic Republic and all progressive peacelove force in Germany     no one can deny that   he creation of the German Democratic Republic be a great victory not only for the german people but for all the people of Europe   or that it be closely connect with peace and security in Europe   the strengthening of the German Democratic Republic and its recognition you all the States of Europe   on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality   be in the interest of their security   and be an essential condition for the settlement of the german problem and a sound basis for any sincere attempt to place the german people on the road to peace and democracy   cooperation   and friendship with all other european people   the agreement between the Soviet Union and West Germany be a dangerous step in the opposite direction   it can not fail to be condemn   you all peace and freedomlove country and people in Europe     it be obvious that the Moscow Treaty be first and foremost the result of bargaining between United States and Soviet imperialist   within the framework of the plan for their global strategy in Europe and other continent   but that Treaty be at the same time an agreement between two new imperialist Powers   soviet social imperialism and west german militarism   and   as such   it be a serious threat not only to the european continent but also to other area of the world which be the object of United StatesSoviet plan of aggression   thus the leader in Moscow have join successive government in Washington in raise West Germany to the level of a main shock force   a principal partner of the two power in put into effect their counterrevolutionary plan and their plan to subjugate all freedomlove people and country   how can we fail on this occasion to remind the Assembly that similar plan be part of the policy of the Western Powers toward Hitler s Germany   but that prove very costly to they   for Hitler s Germany eventually turn on they     the MoscowBonn Treaty be undeniably a new link in the series of plot between the Soviets and the Americans against the world s people   and the serious threat entail in this can not escape the attention of any government which be sincerely concerned with the vital interest of its people   national security and independence and world peace     the albanian Government have always be in sympathy with the justified concern of the European States which be sincerely interested in security and peace in Europe and in the search for appropriate way and mean to normalize the situation in that continent   to deliver it from the hegemony of the two major imperialist power and to reject the idea of sphere of influence   to eliminate the two aggressive bloc dominate by they   and to create favorable circumstance for the development of european cooperation on the basis of respect for independence and national sovereignty   sovereign equality and mutual benefit   that be fully in line with the principle underlie our foreign policy   but   as all these state know full well   such noble objective have nothing in common with the criminal plan of the United States and soviet imperialist and their supporter   in all their activity   in all the pact which they propose to conclude   in all their initiative or proposal   include those on   european security     collective security in Asia    or   international security   present once again   on the initiative of the soviet revisionist   to the present session of the General Assembly the two power be constantly motivate by their insatiable greed to dominate and exploit the people of the world   by their desire to maintain and consolidate their sphere of influence in Europe and elsewhere and to have a free hand in those area   to ensure tranquility to their rear the well to carry out all their various expansionist plan in Asia   Africa and elsewhere   use whatever mean be necessary   even to the extent of threaten or use armed force     there be really no need to prove that this be the true state of affair   it be amply bear out you all international reality and by the hotbed of imperialist war in many area of the world aggression in IndoChina   the Middle East   the Far East   Europe and elsewhere   the military basis of the United States and soviet imperialist in Europe and other continent   their occupation of foreign territory   nuclear blackmail   the arm race   their fleet of warship v hich cruise in the Mediterranean   the Pacific and other sea and ocean and threaten peacelove people and country in those area   it be all bear out   inter alia   by their criminal plan in Europe   where a particular role be assign by they to revengeseeke Germany   their plan for Asia aim particularly at the encirclement of the People s Republic of China and at preparation for war against that country with the cooperation of other aggressive Powers   in particular japanese militarism   how can one claim to guarantee peace in Europe in such condition under the aegis and protection of the two imperialist Powers   american and Soviet     One wonder against whom peace have to be guarantee   who be threaten the peace and security of the people of Europe   can it be those of we from small   peacelove country   in our opinion   to be catch in such SovietAmerican trap as   european security   or   collective security in Asia   be tantamount to serve their aggressive plan or   rather   to throw oneself to the wolf   today more than ever before peace be indivisible   and we can not have peace in Europe and war in Asia and elsewhere     Comrade Enver Hoxha   in his statement on the occasion of the twentyfifth anniversary of the liberation of Albania   state in this connexion    first   the question be who should be assure and by whom   the   european security   which be seek by the soviet revisionist and support by the United States imperialist mean security for their sphere of influence in Europe   security for their military basis and the right for their squadron to patrol european coast   this mean that the people of Europe must legally and officially recognize the right of Moscow and Washington to conserve the special privilege of an imperialist and colonialist nature which they have in various country of Europe   such security boil down to the permanent maintenance in Europe of the status quo of soviet american domination   to have calm ensure on that continent so that the soviet revisionist and american imperialist have some freedom of movement and act freely in Asia   Africa and everywhere else in order to subjugate and enslave people   to reinforce their capitalistic system of exploitation   both at home and in their empire      we believe that international peace and security can be assure only by a resolute opposition and struggle against the two imperialist Powers   against their policy of diktat   aggression and war   any other way would only be grist to the mill of those two Powers   which envisage the enslavement of Europe and the world     we be convinced that no matter what effort be make by the american and soviet imperialist and their collaborator   they will never have the tranquility they seek in Europe   they will run more and more into their own contradiction   and the people of Europe will not accept their hegemony in any guise   they will never allow they to pit Europe against Asia   and they will never allow themselves to be cannon fodder for the realization of the criminal plan of the two power     we be well aware that peacelove Member States condemn the aggressive policy of the two imperialist Powers   their collusion at the expense of the cause of peacelove people and country   their monstrous plan to redivide and dominate the world   we have constantly admire the courageous and just struggle be wage by many country   here in the United Nations and outside it   against this grand conspiracy of the two Powers   but the present international situation require of all Member States faithful to the principle of the independence and equality of States great and small and respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity that they intensify their struggle still far and unite their effort against AmericanSoviet imperialism and collusion and their desire to impose their diktat here   that be in the high interest of international peace and security   which be seriously threaten by the aggressive policy of the American Soviet coalition   that be what be require for the lofty interest of the people who be fight against imperialism   colonialism and reaction     many state have fight unceasingly to do away with the unprecedented anomaly which exist in this Organization as a result of the violation of the lawful right of the People s Republic of China and the usurpation of its place here by a clique of renegade in the service of american imperialism   nevertheless   that scandalous and intolerable situation continue today because of the hostile and aggressive policy of the United States against great socialist China and its manipulation of the United Nations     at this session Albania and fourteen other country have once again place on the Assembly s agenda the question of restore the lawful right of the Peoples s Republic of China in the United Nations    we have do so not only because there be a flagrant and gross violation of the Charter   which affect the sovereign right of a found Member State of the United Nations and permanent member of the Security Council   but also because the elimination of this abnormal   unprecedented situation be an urgent necessity for the United Nations if it be desire to take step towards its recovery and to put it in a position to accomplish its task under the Charter   it be quite clear that without the People s Republic of China   give its authority   its great international role and its tremendous potential   this Organization can not be in a position to make an effective contribution to the settlement of the important problem of our time     the People s Republic of China be a great and powerful socialist State that have have tremendous success in all area and enjoy incomparable international prestige and authority   the dazzling victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution which thwart the plot of the imperialist and revisionist and take control inside the chinese citadel be a live testimony of the invincible force of the great chinese people and guarantee the great role which powerful socialist China now undeniably play in the destiny of the people of the world     the People s Republic of China have become today a great and impregnable fortress in the liberation struggle of the people against imperialism   colonialism and reaction   it be the unshakable rampart of all progressive mankind     we consider that the position take by the General Assembly on this question will prove its determination both to reject the diktat which the two great imperialist power seek lo exercise in the United Nations and to embark on a course in conformity with the aspiration of the people and the fundamental provision of the Charter   we express the hope that the government of peacelove state which constitute the xnajority here   aware of the serious situation in the United Nations   will have the courage to adopt the attitude dictate by their conviction and the true interest of their country and of the Organization itself     the People s Republic of Albania have constantly pursue an independent revolutionary foreign policy in accordance with the high interest of the building and defense of our socialist homeland as well as those of the great cause of the people who be fight for their freedom   their independence and their sacred right freely to determine their own future     the albanian people have be able to defend their socialist homeland in every circumstance against all plot   threat and provocation of imperialist and revisionists   it be ever watchful and prepare at any moment to respond to anyone who dare to raise a hand against it      the albanian people   its party and its Government   have support and will continue strongly to support the legitimate struggle of peacelove people and country against the aggressive policy of the two imperialist Powers   their colonialist collaborator and their lackey of all kind   we have always stand by and shall always stand by the brother people of VietNam   Laos   Cambodia and the other people of IndoChina and Asia in their heroic struggle against the american aggressor and their ally of all kind   we have support and we shall continue unreservedly to support the legitimate fight of the fraternal arab people against the zionist aggressor and american and Soviet imperialist   who be mainly responsible for the present situation in the Middle East   we have vigorously support the struggle of the people of european country the people of Czechoslovakia   the German Democratic Republic and the other people of that continent as well as the people of other continent against the policy of domination   oppression and exploitation of the two imperialist power and against their counterrevolutionary   holy alliance      we be firmly convinced that the people of the entire world   who be fight for a just cause on the vast antiimperialist and anticolonialist front   in ever more resolute combat solidarity   will put down all plot   aggressive plan and aggression   no matter who may be responsible for they   and will win their final victory over their common enemy     the delegation of the People s Republic of Albania   at this session of the General Assembly   guide by the MarxistLeninist principle of our Socialist State   will continue   as in the past   together with other freedomlove people to make its modest contribution to the cause of freedom   independence and genuine cooperation in friendship among all the people of th   world  \n",
       "1     it be a fortunate coincidence that precisely at a time when the United Nations be celebrate its first twentyfive year of existence   an eminent jurist so closely link to our Organization should have be elect to preside over the General Assembly   on behalf of the Argentine Government   it be a pleasure for I to congratulate your Excellency   Mr   President   on this felicitous choice     through you I should also like to express the appreciation of the argentine delegation to Mrs   Angie BrooksRandolph of Liberia   for the work she perform as President of the twentyfourth session     from this rostrum   the Argentine Government wish to express to the delegation of the United Arab Republic its regret and sympathy upon the recent death of his Excellency President Gamal Abdel Nasser   the loss of this outstanding statesman have not only plunge the arab world into mourn   but have also deeply grieve all those who greatly value his capacity to contribute actively to the establishment of peace in the Middle East     when the Organization of the United Nations be create in    its founder have two fundamental purpose in mind   on the one hand   solemnly to formulate the basic principle of the international system and   on the other   to establish a legal framework in keep with the political and social need of the immediate postwar era   both objective be the result of the historical experience of mankind and of the interest and aspiration which all civilized nation can in no way renounce   the enunciation of the purpose and principle of the United Nations be thus consider as a sign of moral evolution and maturity of people     the need to rely upon a stable management of international relation be also deeply root in the history of nation   in the course of time   a number of philosophical and legalpolitical current propose guide principle that go beyond State limit   up to the beginning of the twentieth century   for more or less lengthy period   international peace have be ensure by mean of treaty sign among the great Powers   these lay the groundwork for peace and de facto establish condition for international stability   the socalled   european concert   be good proof of this concept which restrict the active access of the noneuropean state to international life     the grow democratization of the international society and the part play in the solution of controversy by the small country contribute to the crumbling of that restrict concept of the system and to lay the foundation for a legalpolitical structure of worldwide scope rest upon the consent and equality of States base on a distribution of responsibility   this be precisely what the League of Nations seek to accomplish   the catastrophe of the Second World War be the clear proof of the way in which that organization have to yield to the trend that finally prove it incapable of maintain peace among States     however   the need for an international normative system be sum up in a number of international instrument and conference   from the Atlantic Charter in   to Dumbarton Oaks in    it be the San Francisco Conference   however   which be ultimately to adopt the Charter of the United Nations   thus take those historic aspiration up again and embark upon a new era in the management of international affair     it might justifiably have be feel at that time that   when the United Nations link the ideal of peace and security with the existence of adequate legal machinery that it have thereby ensure international stability and harmony among nation     today it be not difficult to prove that   although the principle may still be valid   the actual force of many of they be relative   future historian of this quartercentury will no doubt use as a guide thread the listing of constant violation of those principle in almost all area of the world   they will also be able to show the lack of efficiency of many measure   the existence of which seem to end at the time of their adoption     there be a notorious maladjustment between institution and reality   we be not refer here to the discrepancy that may exist between what should be and what factually be   we know that ideal always precede their practical fulfillment   history have show to what extent idea that at one time be deem Utopian gradually become specific and indispensable factor of our everyday life     the discrepancy between the normative framework and reality to which we refer here be of a different nature   we have draw away from the empiric possibility that exist   and we sometimes tend to forget that our Organization be support by the political will of the Member States   Proclaiming principle do not in itself make they reality   and it be not sufficient to multiply the legal machinery when the latter be not base upon the social reality it be intend to regulate     furthermore   if we be fully aware of the difficulty that our Organization face in settle important question bear on international peace and security   it be difficult to understand how year after year we be willing to allow the agenda of the United Nations to be swell by secondary item which consume so much time and money and be doom to remain without solution   the bureaucratic and budgetary growth of our Organization and the useless waste of effort be unavoidable consequence of such an attitude     Mention have be make of the need to revise the Charter   theoretically speak we can not but support such a measure   but from the practical point of view we be fully aware of the almost insuperable problem that such a step imply   perhaps it might be more worthwhile to make an effort to try to use to the utmost those resource provide for and authorize by the Charter   instead of undertake a scarcely possible revision   particularly with regard to the peaceful settlement of dispute   if   furthermore   we wish to act with a practical awareness   we must bear in mind that some of the measure approve by this General Assembly or by the Security Council require adequate financial resource for full implementation   very often extremely serious functional maladjustment be due to the fact that this elementary circumstance have be overlook     the United Nations will be what its Member States wish it to be   what be most serious be that as we pare down our active participation or neglect the consideration of our possibility it become more difficult to put into practice the Purposes and Principles of the Charter   thus endanger international peace and security     the skepticism and discouragement with which many of our contemporary gauge the action of the United Nations be understandable   we   as representative of the States Members of the Organization   have the duty to be honest with ourselves and to adopt a critical stand that will permit we to judge both our success and our failure objectively     in order to carry out such an analysis   we might establish a threefold division of problem   first of all   there be those that have be practically or entirely settle   and in this case our satisfaction at what have be accomplish be justify   secondly   there be those problem that have acquire a chronic degree of gravity and have be await solution for year   in this case discouragement be well found   and it be urgent that we adopt effective measure to correct the structural and operational flaw in our Organization   Thirdly   there be the new problem create by the emergence of fact that have change the world situation   in this last case we should act with sufficient determination so that these matter will become part of the first of this series and not swell the rank of the second group     Decolonization belong in the first group of problem   this have surely be one of the outstanding phenomenon of our day   New States in full enjoyment of their sovereignty   have become active participant in the international system   the principle of the self determination of people have thus find its true application   and its observance have help to enrich the international political situation   Resolution    XV    the tenth anniversary of which we shall soon be mark   serve to hasten the windingup process of the colonialist regime and to ensure a great equality   at least in the political field   among the people of the world   the Argentine Republic be firmly convince that decolonization must be totally carry out     for that reason we continue to be concern over the situation of the Territories of southern Africa which still remain under colonial administration   within this context   the atmosphere be far trouble by the existence of a government which illegally hold power in Southern Rhodesia   by the racial discrimination that be represent by apartheid and by the non recognition of the authority of the United Nations of which we be witness in Namibia     in this context I wish to refer to a matter of vital importance to the Argentine Republic   the question of the Malvinas Islands   true to its diplomatic tradition   my Government agree to negotiate with the United Kingdom regard the dispute over the sovereignty of the island   in so do   we be interpret the spirit and the letter of resolution    XX   and   at the same time   we declare our irrevocable decision share you all the people of Argentina to have the Malvinas Islands restore to our territorial   heritage   since the end of the last session of this General Assembly negotiation have continue on the diplomatic level   it be with great interest that we pursue the talk regard the problem of communication between the Islands and the argentine mainland   for we believe that these be the first step towards the solution of the dispute   in due course   we shall report on the result of these talk     those whose vote have make it possible for Argentina and the United Kingdom to begin their talk with a view to end a situation which be incompatible with the term of resolution    XV   do so because they consider that decolonization be an irreversible process that brook no exception   there can   furthermore   be no doubt that the question of the Malvinas Islands be an obstacle to the development of the tie that should link Argentina with the United Kingdom increasingly closely   therefore   the solution to this problem can not be unduly delay   my Government reaffirm be right to raise the matter again in this Assembly if the talk fail or if they be excessively prolong     we believe it urgent that these case should be solve so that they will not remain to swell the number of problem in the second of the group I have mention   that be   the problem pende solution     the question of general and complete disarmament also belong in this category   if we consider the consequence of the qualitative development of the new system of weaponry on the life of international society   it be difficult to presume that the effort to achieve an easing of political tension within the system can possibly show last result while the arsenal of the great power remain at their present level or be increase     for this reason my Government attach considerable importance to the strategic arm limitation talk which be take place bilaterally between the United States and the Soviet Union   but we feel it necessary to recall the fact that urgent measure should be adopt for nuclear disarmament within the context of general and complete disarmament under effective international control     Argentina continue to participate actively in the deliberation of the Conference of the Committee   on disarmament convince as it be of the vital importance of seek ari understanding that might help to dissipate the threat of a nuclear catastrophe     that Conference have submit to this present session a draft treaty prohibit the emplacement of nuclear and other weapon of mass destruction on the seabed and ocean floor and on the subsoil thereof    the document on which we be now to take a stand contain significant change compare to the one that be consider at the twentyfourth session of the General Assembly   some of these tend to protect the legitimate interest of the coastal States and at the same time prevent those provision cover verification from prejudge matter touch upon the law of the sea   Argentina attach special relevance to all of these principle   as be attest to by our active participation in the amendment of the previous draft   the text   such as it have be present to the General Assembly   have our support and we hope that it will be approve by a widespread majority of Member States     the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament have continue the examination of the question of chemical and bacteriological   biological   weapon on the basis of the two draft convention and other proposal which be submit to it   the Committee have dedicate itself to the treatment of both type of armament and have seriously consider the political and technical aspect pertain to the subject   my Government attach special significance to the problem of verification procedure which it might be necessary to adopt   it be to be hope that the General Assembly will recommend that the Committee should continue this task which   although difficult   be nevertheless most necessary     with regard to the elaboration of a detailed program on general and complete disarmament   the report submit by the Committee show that this matter be one of its main concern   we deem it advisable to reiterate that the aim of the program must be the achieving of general and complete disarmament under effective international control   on various occasion we have already warn about the negative consequence of collateral measure which   because of their discriminatory character   actually constitute the   disarmament of the unarmed   and do not signify a true contribution to the achievement of a true general armament reduction     there can be no doubt that the conflict in the Middle East be one of the typical case that have not as yet find a settlement within the framework of the United Nations   it be to be hope that the encouraging symptom notice lately will help to allay the suspicion that have be feel by both party   thus the first step may then be take towards the effective implementation of resolution      of the Security Council   in the drafting of which Argentina play a significant part   we believe that this resolution point to the right road to peace   furthermore   my Government reaffirm its faith in the jarring mission as a means towards understanding and   through the participation of argentine officer   will continue to cooperate in the supervision of the ceasefire in the Suez Canal area     SouthEast Asia be also a source of serious concern   that grave problem can be settle only if negotiation among those directly involve be pursue in a spirit in keeping with the Charter   the continuous delay which hinder the elimination of this permanent breach of the peace be contrary to the purpose of the United Nations     we can not in this context overlook the constant danger be run by those who   in their capacity as news correspondent   be present in the zone of conflict in order to carry out their difficult task of keep world public opinion inform of the battle more efficiently and accurately   respect for human right during armed conflict require special observance in the case of news correspondent during hostility   my own country be prepared to consider measure to guarantee great security to those engage in this important work     both the situation in the Middle East and that of SouthEast Asia be of concern to the community of nation not only because of the constant loss in human life   but also because   despite their apparently regional nature   they may endanger the security of the entire system   we know full well that the interest at stake in this case go beyond th   direct participant in the struggle   reference to these case be necessary in a statement make before this Assembly   the trouble with periodic repetition be that the problem we be analyze tend to become Commonplace   nothing could be more grave and serious than to accustom ourselves to live with war and destruction and to think that both be inevitable at a give time in history   our insistence therefore in refer to these conflict must not be interpret as a repetition of just another rhetorical sentence   but as the proof of a deeply feel concern     among the third group of problem mention   that be   those that have emerge recently   must be list a question that warrant special attention because it seriously bear upon international peace and security   I refer to the committing of act of violence and terrorism that constitute true crime in term of international criminal law   violence and subversion   especially in Latin America   have acquire such a scope and magnitude in certain case as to affect the very basis of international order   if we truly wish to practice tolerance as a fundamental attribute of democracy in our continent   we can not permit indiscriminate violence   allege pretext of confused political ideal in order to convert crime offensive to human conscience into instrument of social transformation   the argentine people categorically reject the committing of those crime   which be completely alien to its way of life and to the philosophy of freedom which support it     in the Organization of American States the Republic of Argentina have point out the need to define and then to prevent and to punish this type of crime   the Argentine Government understand that it js incumbent upon each State to adopt those measure it deem necessary to repress act that violate order and security within its own territory   yet the knowledge that in many case terrorist and kidnapper receive some kind of foreign assistance in the form of money   weapon or training force we to consider the need to encourage concert action on a worldwide scale so that those individual will not escape justice   within the regional framework   the InterAmerican Juridical Committee four day ago   on   September   approve a draft convention on terrorism and kidnapping of person with a view to extortion   which will be submit for the consideration of member of the Organization of American States   it should be point out that article   of that draft provide that the Convention will remain open   for signature by the member States of the Organization of American States   as well as any other State Member of the United Nations or any other state invite to do so by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States      the increase frequency of act of hijacking deserve unanimous condemnation you all States Members of the Organization   Argentina consider that the United Nations should adopt adequate measure to prevent recurrence of this crime     I wish now to refer to one of the subject of great significance on the agenda of this twentyfifth session of the General Assembly   namely   the Second United Nations Development Decade and the plan for a global strategy which we be to set in motion during the commemorative period of the present session   Lengthy have be the road cover in the last few year in order to put into practice the principle of the Charter in matter of international cooperation for economic and social progress of all people   a clear example of this be what take place during the decade of the s when   for the first time   an effort be make to establish equal opportunity for country at different level of development   through a systematization of effort to achieve specific growth objective   during those year the aspiration of the develop country be clearly see and intense multilateral activity take place     in the various United Nations specialized agency   in the Economic and Social Council and in the General Assembly   we have in the last few year succeed in identify the element on which to base national effort and international cooperation   those element have be embody in a considerable number of document on global and sectoral objective for economic and social development   with regard to these objective   there exist an almost unanimous agreement on the part of the different sector   or at least a sound and honest will to reach a compromise     the study of the final form the agreement on political measure for tne fulfillment of those objective should have be at present in the last stage of negotiation   and it be a promising sign that those talk be not on the substance of the problem but only on a timetable for implementation   this fact alone render obvious the spirit in which the international community be enter the decade of the seventy   a decade which will be call upon to put into practice agree measure for the achievement of the objective of development     in the implementation of those measure an equal share of responsibility will be bear by both the develop and the develop country   it be a matter of unite effort and of add to the solidarity of the more industrialized nation   as well as the determination of the other country to make serious and continuous progress along the road of their own development   Sterile confrontation or the complacency of the recipient of aid can only delay solution and benefit those who thrive on inertia   for this reason we believe in conciliate interest   our strategy must consist in promote a range of positive solution which   by gradually include new measure or widen the scope of already adopt instrument   will raise to an increasingly high and efficient level economic cooperation among all member of the Organization   only thus will we reach the target set for the Second United Nations Development Decade     one of the factor that have have the great impact on the history of the last twentyfive year have be the astounding progress of science and technology   Ours have be call the era of the scientific civilization   that description be not an arbitrary one   never before have the destiny of mankind depend so much on the rational conquest of nature   never before have discovery in the field of science and their immediate application through technology so substantially alter human and interstate relation   those country which lack adequate mean in order to utilize science and technology fully will be leave outside the flow of history   the intellectual power have today become the fourth sector of the economy   the advanced community be in fact   study society      the Argentine Republic be ready to intensify far the policy of achieve agreement with other state for cooperation and mutual assistance in the field of science and technology   within the United Nations we shall support as we do in the Organization of American States any proposal design to encourage basic research and the transfer of apply technology   we believe that if this transfer be not carry out and if international sharing of the burden of research be not increase   all other effort make to bridge the gap between country at different level of development will be in vain     we firmly believe that multilateral cooperation   such as that carry out in the specialized agency and body   particularly in the United Nations Development program   be a proof of what the United Nations can achieve when there be apolitical will of commitment in the field of assistance     when modern science and technology become a decisive factor in international life   new field be open up for the legal regulation or settlement of relation among States   one of these be that of the seabed and ocean floor   Argentina consider that the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limit of national jurisdiction should be consider the common heritage of mankind   it be unfortunate that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the SeaBed and the Ocean Floor beyond the limit of National Jurisdiction have not yet reach an agreement on a declaration of principle to be submit to the General Assembly   in accordance with the term of resolution   B   xxiv    the Republic of Argentina believe that the Declaration of principle should reflect the necessary adaptation of the law to the change that occur in international life     once the Committee have draft the regime applicable to the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limit of national jurisdiction   the time will have come for the convening of a comprehensive conference on the law of the sea   that conference will have   to deal with all those aspect that may require revision or establishment due to the appearance of interest or situation call for new international legal regulation   thus   the criterion set forth by the General Assembly in resolution   B   XXIV   will be comply with     Argentina wish to express its satisfaction at the work do by the Special Committee on Principles of International Law concern Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States   my country have have the honor of participate in the work of the Special Committee since its creation in   and have endeavor at all time to make a most constructive contribution to its deliberation   we consider that the draft declaration that have finally be prepare be a valuable document for the codification and progressive development of fundamental principle of international law and we be ready to give it our full support when it be consider by the General Assembly     when the Charter of the United Nations be sign in the city of San Francisco twentyfive year ago   precisely   year have elapse since publication of a short essay of prophetic intuition   in his native city of Konigsberg   Emmanuel Kant   in    publish his   Essay on perpetual peace    in it he attempt to show that universal peace be not only desirable and conceivable   but necessary and inevitable   in order to achieve it   there have to exist an international order base on a law consent to you all nation   thus     each state   even the small   could expect respect for its security and its right   not through its own power or its own definition of the law   but simply as the result of the existence of a great society of nation   all abide by law adopt through their united will      the important fact in our day be that this united will for peace   consider as an indivisible entity   should be universal in scope   perhaps the very stability of our international system as a conditioning factor require that we do not set aside the undeniable factual reality of the world of today   if this be the case   then we have the right to wonder how this concern can be render compatible with a restricted universalization of the United Nations     in the course of this statement we have mention a series of fact that be of concern to we as they affect peace or hamper the effective achievement of international cooperation   I do not believe it difficult to agree with this analysis   but this would not be complete without mention   as one of the undeniable achievement of the Organization   the fact that it have localize and solve some of the conflict that might have have serious effect on international peace and security   the United Nations have effectively contribute to keep alive our awareness of the danger to all mankind of a generalized conflict   it be this very awareness which lead we to view with interest the signing of the recent Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the USSR which will contribute to detente in Europe     a hundred year ago   a great argentine thinker   Juan Bautista Alberdi   write that    war be the justice every one work out for himself fail world justice   World justice be lack because the world be deprive of unity and do not as yet constitute an international society   therefore   the way to abolish war be to help the consolidation of the world into a State of States   a society of society   a nation of nation   as a type of entity to work out a justice that   today   everyone work out for himself   by mean of war      in    we now have this   nation of nation    if justice be to be impose by the threat or use of force   and if man   in all area   have not yet achieve the dignity he deserve   the future will hold we responsible     the   Argentine Republic   within the framework of its international commitment   will maintain the principle of freedom of action of its foreign policy in an ever increasingly interdependent world and pledge all its effort to fulfill the desire for peace and cooperation which twentyfive year ago be embody in the Charter of the United Nations

       "2     it be a pleasure for I to extend to you   Mr   President   the warm congratulation of the Australia Government and its delegation to this General Assembly on your election to the Presidency   the distinguished part you have play in the service of your country and in the development of this Organization   notably through your authoritative study of the Charter   make you a fitting and admirable choice to preside over this session     in congratulate you I also want to express through you the thank and appreciation of the australian delegation for the efficient and dedicated manner in which your predecessor   Mrs   Angie Brooks Randolph of Liberia   discharge her responsibility as President of the twentyfourth session     as so many of my colleague have say   this twentyfifth anniversary session be an appropriate occasion to examine the working of our Organization its success and failure   its merit and shortcoming     look back to   we should keep in mind the a      nation of the founder member of the United Nations in San Francisco and the problem they have to solve     today   under the compulsion of circumstance and event   we must ask ourselves   o what extent the United Nations have succeed   I   paramount and immediate importance   we must ask whether we can make any contribution to improve its performance   this   I emphasize   be the great test of statesmanship and sincerity of our time     let we recall the condition that exist when the Charter be sign   it be an unhappy and disturbed world in which the most destructive war of all time be still be fight   a war in which my country and many other   large and small   be still heavily involve   a war wnidi have directly or indirectly dominate people s daily live everywhere throughout six year of struggle against violent and tyrannical oppression   it be a more disturbed world than that which have give birth a generation early to the League of Nations   it be a world in which there be a passionate yearn for peace and order   for a system of rule for the orderly conduct of relation between nation   for the peaceful settlement of dispute and for the improvement of the quality of life for all mankind     in this mood of hope and determination our government meet in San Francisco   there be never much disagreement about the name to be give to the new Organization   the worldwide alliance of Powers   then within sight of final victory    have already become know as the United Nations     the forging of its Charter   on the other hand   be necessarily a more difficult process   after the traumatic experience of the Second World War the nation unite in war be ready enough to recognize the need for a more broadly base and more effective institution than the League of Nations   a new institution which would have to accommodate the aspiration and interest of more than fifty nation   the major Powers have difference to reconcile amongst themselves and the right of the small nation be vigorously press   not least of all by the australian delegation   thus the Charter that emerge be inevitably the product of compromise   implicit as well as explicit   this should be recognize in any evaluation of the past     the Charter be found on the proposition that the major allied Powers   those which carry the heavy burden of the war   would share the main responsibility for preserve the peace   if this concept be to be successful it have to be postulate on the continued existence among the major ally of the same unity of purpose that have carry they to the point of victory and on a common interest in maintain world peace in   he future   it be with that expectation   indeed on t edition   that the major ally be give a special position under the Charter   with right and obligation exceed those of all other member     even before the Charter be sign   suspicion and discord have arise amongst they   succeed year have see an intensify conflict of ideology and worldwide clash of national interest   at time it even seem that the objective be conflict and turmoil and not peace and security   and the promotion   rather than the suppression   of armed conflict in area of competitive interest   those difference of outlook   interest and ideology among the permanent member of the Security Council have prevent the Council from perform the role intend for it by the Charter     we cm speculate about what might have happen if the Military Staff Committee   so hopefully envisage under Chapter VII of the Charter   have be allow to take shape and to assume the function plan for it     we might also deplore our failure to settle the question of how the cost of peacekeeping operation be to be share equitably     having say that   we should acknowledge that we have be spare the horror of a third world war   Undoubtedly   the basic explanation up to the present have be the rapid development of weapon technology   another world war have be too horrible for any nation to contemplate   no one could win   the world as a whole would be certain to suffer disastrous consequence     the United Nations may perhaps claim some small credit for provide a safety valve for public debate and a forum in which the great Powers have be force to explain and justify their attitude and action   in its twentyfive year the United Nations have not be able to prevent a number of limited war of the conventional type   nor have it find the answer to insidious threat to national integrity and security through the newly develop technique of infiltration   subversion and insurgency     the peacekeeping record have not   however   be wholly bleak   Korea be an illustration   even without agreement among the major Powers   in the Middle East   Kashmir   the Congo and Cyprus   United Nations force and truce supervisory team have in the past play a significant role in critical situation which could have grow considerably bad without their presence     despite strain   division and its limited record of achievement in its primary role   th   United Nations have survive for twentyfive year   that indicate that many member recognize that there be a residual or net value in the Organization and that they still hope for a future in which it will perform function which measure up to their expectation     as we look to the future   it be surely no exaggeration to say that the reputation of the United Nations and the degree of respect it enjoy among people everywhere will hinge on its performance in help to settle dispute among nation and in keep the peace     Undoubtedly   there be room for improvement in the peacekeeping procedure of the Organization and the machinery provide for the settlement of dispute   but practical success in this peacekeeping role must depend ultimately on subjective factor the attitude   intention and honesty of purpose of the great power and of the individual nation concern in particular dispute     Australia have consistently support the peacekeeping operation of the United Nations with both man and money   as early as   we be one of the three member of one of the first mediation and peacekeeping mission set up by the United Nations the United Nations Commission for Indonesia   we contribute substantial force to the United Nations action in Korea     at the present time we be make a significant contribution to peace observation and supervision in Kashmir   the Middle East and Cyprus   we will continue   as a member of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations   to support effort to formulate procedure design to increase the effectiveness of future operation and to ensure that they be properly finance   we will continue to maintain our firm belief in the United Nations Charter and be convince that in the faithful and devoted support of its principle lie the good hope for the future peace and progress of mankind     from peacekeeping and the peaceful settlement of dispute   let I turn to the painful and difficult problem of arm control and the reduction of armament   the constant and frightening improvement in military technology and the complexity of the problem involve in effect balanced armament reduction make the subject of disarmament a difficult one for most to understand   this difficulty of understanding be   no excuse for think it be an academic exercise divorce from the reality of daily live     all of we know that the continue discussion and negotiation on the control and reduction of armament   protract   complex and technical as they be   can vitally affect the security of all country   Security may be indivisible   but danger to security vary in nature and degree from region to region and from country to country     the advent of the nuclear balance of terror and the knowledge of other equally horrifying weapon of mass destruction have bring home to we forcibly how vulnerable we be to the whim of scientific progress in the notoriously accidentprone hand of mankind   surely it be right that our effort to control armament should concentrate in the first instance on limit and control weapon of mass destruction     that say   it should be add that a worldwide balance of force   if it be to be effective in contain aggression and preserve security   must include the balance of conventional as well as nuclear armament   it be with conventional weapon that the many act of aggression have be commit in the year since the Charter come into force   and we must unhappily expect that there will be more   to pay less attention to the threat that be familiar and traditional than to the threat that be almost unimaginable but controllable be contrary to our mutual interest and welfare     I believe we can be a little encourage by the progress that have be make in arm control and disarmament   First   Australia have sign the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons subject to certain understanding and interpretation   we hope it will in time become a fully effective barrier against the proliferation of nuclear weapon   secondly   indication of progress in the strategic arm limitation talk between the United States and the Soviet Union also offer some hope   thirdly   the prospect of agreement to prevent the placing of weapon of mass destruction on the seabed be also welcome   the australian Government hope that the text of the draft treaty now before the Assembly will gain widespread support   fourthly   there be also ground for hope that   as a result of discussion at the conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva this year   we may be at or near the threshold of substantive progress towards supplement and strengthen the prohibition on chemical and biological weapon of war that already exist in the Geneva Protocol of      I have speak at length about the influence that affect the balance between peace and war because the paramount purpose of the United Nations must still be to preserve peace and outlaw war and because this paramount purpose have not always be well serve     let I turn now to another purpose of the Charter which can be measure by the increase in membership of the United Nations in twentyfive year   I refer to the progress from dependent status to full sovereignty and statehood of more than half of the present member of the Organization     the circumstance in which those section of the Charter relate to dependent Territories come to be draft in San Francisco be worth remember   the Covenant of the League of Nations break new ground   it introduce and put into effect in the Mandate system the novel concept that the international community hold a degree of responsibility for the guidance of colonial people towards selfgovernment and independence   by   that concept have be strengthen and develop by the experience of the Second World War   selfdetermination for dependent Territories become the accept goal   and be give wide and more precise expression in Chapters XI   XII and XIII of the Charter     I note here that the australian delegation at San Francisco take a particularly active part in the drafting of those Chapters   especially those section deal with the right of the people of dependent Territories and the obligation of the administer power and of the United Nations towards they     since that time there have be profound and rapid change   which be continue   the Charter set the target and the standard   it only remain for the metropolitan Powers to accept responsibility for the change that inevitably have to be make   in most case they be accept willingly and generously     there be also a complementary responsibility for the dependent people themselves first to understand their opportunity and responsibility and then work towards achieve they   in some case freedom and national sovereignty come only after a lengthy and sometimes bitter struggle   in most case they come more happily as a result of a rational acceptance of the situation by both side and a peaceful and mutually satisfactory transfer of political power     in this process of the development of dependent people to nationhood the United Nations   reflect the liberal and humanitarian instinct of mankind   and sometimes its impatience   have play a significant part     to be specific   I want to speak briefly about one dependent area of great concern to Australia   in which this process of develop be take place rapidly   this be the Territory of Papua and New Guinea     let I describe the position there   it be the large of the remain dependent Territories outside the continent of Africa   it lie immediately to the north of Australia   its area be approximately    square mile   and its population total two and a quarter million   it be a large unit than many member of the United Nations   because of its exceptionally rugged terrain and the successive wave of migration that occur over the century   these two and a quarter million people be divide amongst themselves by ethnic and tribal difference and also by something like   different language not different dialect   but different language   it be this fragmented society that be now draw together into an identifiable nation     my delegation report each year to this Assembly about the progress make and the difficulty encounter during the precede twelve month   the proclaim policy be to ensure the exercise by the people of the Territory of their inalienable right to self determination   we be now do   and will continue to do   all we can to prepare the people of the Territory for the termination of dependent status and their accession to full selfgovernment and independence     Next year another United Nations Visiting Mission   the seventh   will go to the Territory and will be able to see for itself the striking progress that have be make since the visit of the last mission in      early this year I have the honor to lead the australian delegation to the meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East   which recommend that the Territory of Papua and New Guinea be admit as one of its associate member   a recommendation which have since be unanimously approve by the Economic and Social Council at its fortyninth session      the australian Government think that this approval and other activity   such as participation in the South Pacific Conference   be recognition of the grow national identity of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and further step along the road towards selfdetermination     I should like now to range northward and westward from New Guinea into Asia   let I say that I presume to speak about the general situation throughout Asia because of the great importance to this Organization of event there and their particular importance to Australia     in our view   to judge from the agenda of this twentyfifth session   Asia receive less attention than it be entitle to from the General Assembly   I would like to think that this be a good sign   that a peaceful and wellordere Asia offer few serious problem to the international community   up to a point this may be true   in the view of my government it be fair to say that apart from the few serious and easily identifiable major problem   there be evidence throughout eastern   southeastern and southern Asia of a measure of stability   vitality and economic progress that we would not have dare to hope for twenty year ago     of these major problem China be critical   we shall again be consider the question of the representation of China in the United Nations   Australia   situate at the edge of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to SouthEast Asia   be more concerned with its longterm relation with mainland China than most member of this Organization   we see plenty of evidence to our north of how much the enormous size   power   and influence of mainland China intrude into and affect the interest and the calculation of small nation   my predecessor in office   when speak to the Assembly   have emphasize that the problem of China s relation with its immediate neighbor and with the rest of the world outside Asia be much great and more complex than the question of Communist China s admission to this Assembly     we see as clearly as anyone the need for an accommodation with the Peking regime   and we be as anxious as anyone that an accommodation be achieve   but we constantly run up against the mirror image   in its conduct of its external relation   of the ruthlessness and harshness which have be a feature of the present regime s treatment of its own people   above all   we be conscious of the need for a settlement of the future of the people of Taiwan that take full account of the wish of   million people   more than the population of Australia and oft the majority of Member country of the United Nations   the interest and welfare of   million people be not to be treat as an incidental consideration in some package deal   the Assembly have a grave responsibility to ensure that the status and the right of these people be protect and guarantee     it be sometimes claim that the admission of Communist China to the United Nations will act as a catalyst in open the way to well relation between China and that part of the international community from which Peking seem to have choose to isolate itself   we do not at present share this optimistic view   on the other hand   we suppose that the adoption by Communist China of a more reasonable attitude towards international society as a whole   and towards the purpose and principle of the Charter   would facilitate its entry into this Organization     I turn next to the grave problem now face we in Asia   it be an unhappy reflection of the failure of the United Nations in its primary role of keeper of the peace that the VietNam situation have never be properly debate here   let alone consider as to possible action   everywhere else   of course   the VietNam war have be for five year and more one of the great divisive issue of our time   it be understandable that the world s conscience should have revolt against the fearful loss and hardship that the people of VietNam have suffer almost without interruption since well before the United Nations come into be   it be less understandable   in the view of the australian Government   that the people of South VietNam who be manifestly the victim of aggression in its most naked and ruthless form and the elect Government of South VietNam which have demonstrate beyond doubt that it reflect the wish of the great majority of the people should have have to undergo so much biased and totally unfair criticism     the outrage they have be compel to endure from their internal and external aggressor   act in complete defiance of the Geneva Agreements of    need to be precisely state   intimidation   kidnapping   extortion and assassination have the same meaning in anyone s language   whatever device be employ to present they under the guise of   liberation      the day may come we all hope it will when the people of North and South VietNam can be reunite   in the meantime there be a wellmarked boundary between the north and the south   both half of VietNam could begin to achieve the economic stability and wellbeing of some of their neighbor if only the regime in Hanoi could be persuade to give up its hopeless struggle and withdraw behind the demilitarize zone     the spillover of the VietNam conflict into neighbor Laos and Cambodia be well enough know to this Assembly   at least in general term   the representative of those country will   I be sure   describe it in detail     Australia have be active throughout the past decade in help the Government of Laos to maintain a stable economy and thereby to resist the familiar pressure and encroachment of an alien and unwanted ideology     more recently the same kind of pressure have be bring to bear on Cambodia   there the North VietNamese aggression be a blatant violation of the country s neutrality and independence   in May of this year the Australian Government take part in a regional conference of Foreign Ministers hold in Djakarta to consider this enlarged threat     that meeting of Foreign Ministers be a constructive initiative by the asian country most directly concerned to try to ensure respect for the sovereignty   territorial integrity and neutrality of Cambodia   the collective view of that meeting be subsequently communicate accurately and forcefully to the Secretary General   to the government of the major power and in a number of other capital by three select envoy from the group     I sincerely hope that the General Assembly will recognize this as a valuable regional initiative that be not only provide for but encourage under Chapter VIII of the Charter     a great deal have be say   and more be bind to be say in the course of this Assembly   about the situation in the Middle East   Emotions be run high as a result of difficulty that have impede the United States effort to restart peace talk and because of the recent series of criminal act against civil aircraft and their passenger   the present situation be extremely delicate   in these circumstance I do not believe that any more detailed comment by I at this stage would be helpful     let I turn to one other topic   in the last twenty five year the world have see tremendous progress in the physical science and in industrial technology   these advance in science and technology will bring great benefit to mankind   they can also produce major side effect   often of a harmful kind     an international organization like this   concern with the maintenance of peace and security and the promotion of international economic cooperation and the raising of living standard   must concern itself continuously with these development   in our view   the United Nations have a significant and urgent responsibility to assist in the application of science and technology to national development in the most constructive and beneficial way   conversely   we must do all in our power to minimize the harmful effect of technological change     the United Nations have a relate responsibility   equally important   to devise an acceptable framework of international law in which the development of science and technology can proceed in those sphere beyond the conventional limit of national jurisdiction   at present the pace of such development be threaten to outstrip the capacity of international lawyer to devise such a framework     it be a matter of regret that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space have not be able to negotiate a convention on liability for damage cause by space object   Australia   with most other country   have argue strongly in favor of a convention that would provide certain   prompt and equitable compensation for the victim of space damage   this remain an area in which technology be move dangerously far ahead of the law     Advances in science and technology have also create a need for international legal action in regard to the sea and the seabed   the problem involve be urgent   comprise both the review of old concept and the development of new one   the substantive decision that must be make will be important for government and their people and for the international community at large     those who be responsible for take these decision must bear in mind that the system or system they devise will have to deal equitably with differing and often compete national and international interest if they be to gain widespread acceptance   the alternative to coherent multilateral action with respect to the problem of the sea and the seabed could well be an unmanageable situation     of all the consequence of the introduction and intensive application of new development to science and technology none have give rise to wide concern than their effect upon the human environment   our natural surrounding be be increasingly recognize as an irreplaceable part of our heritage   the problem of pollution have arise in their stark form in the highly industrialize country   and it be to be hope that those country where pollution of the environment have not yet reach the same crisis point will be able to profit from the lesson learn elsewhere     Australia s own situation   where the noxious byproduct of industrial development be as much a subject for debate and action as the need to develop our natural resource   put we in a particularly good position to share with all region of the world the fruit of cur experience in cope with man s environment   as a basis on which a contribution can be make to help solve this problem the australian Senate recently appoint a Select Committee to report on water pollution   the report have be complete and consideration be now be give to the most appropriate method of prevent further pollution     we do not need to be remind that this year be not only the twentyfifth anniversary of this Organization but also the first year of the Second United Nations Development Decade   we in Australia understand how fervently the develop country want the Second Development Decade to succeed   it be in this spirit that our representative have participate in the various United Nations and other forum which have be discuss the preparation for the Second Development Decade over the past two year   and particularly the aid program     three week ago I make an extensive review before the Australian Parliament of our policy of assistance for the develop country   I reaffirm our position at last week s ministerial meeting in Tokyo of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development     we have long think that the only valid test of a country s approach to development assistance be its performance and its deeply feel desire to be helpful   we believe that Australia s record of performance compare well with that of other   our aid to develop country increase substantially during the s   and I have recently be able to inform the australian Parliament that it will again increase significantly in the first year of the Second Development Decade     the budget for   provide for US   million of official development assistance that be   assistance under the direction or control of government   it do not include private capital flow   which be outside our jurisdiction and competence   mostly   this assistance will be in the form of grant carry no burden of interest or repayment   this will be an increase of   per cent over the previous financial year   of this amount    million be appropriate to asian country an increase of   per cent over the previous year     I have also recently announce important new plan regard Australia s intention to assist   in particular   Indonesia   Cambodia and South VietMam     there be one other aspect of our aid program that I want to mention   we want to ensure flexibility in any statement of aim for the Second Development Decade that may be adopt this year by the Assembly   the reason be clear   Conditions in the various develop country be different and require different treatment   Donor country also face a variety of condition   and these must influence the commitment they can make     in the view of my government there have be a tendency   especially here at the United Nations   to concentrate on the gross amount of aid rather than the quantity of official aid and the quality and effectiveness of economic aid   thus there have be too much preoccupation with percentage target and date for reach they   I have reaffirm Australia s support for an aid target for donor country of   per cent of gross national product   as define by resolution    II   of the second session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development   which specifically acknowledge the position of capital import country like Australia   it be essential   however   not to let debate about the timing and level of target distract attention from the overall need for donor to increase the amount of their total aid and particularly their official development assistance     I conclude by return to the present condition of the United Nations and to the fault and merit most of we see in it   like most large institution   it threaten to become a prey to bureaucratization   there be a grow danger of rigidity in its proceeding   it threaten to be submerge under an accumulation of paper   committee and subcommittee continue to proliferate and duplication of effort seem to increase     it be a far cry from the day when the late David Owen set up the Secretariat with a desk   a chair and no telephone   mere survival of the hectic pressure of the three month of a General Assembly session be an achievement in itself   there be a tendency to regard every United Nations resolution as an end in itself and not as a means to an end   in all this there be much room for improvement     it be not basically the Charter that be at fault   though we in Australia would be receptive to change in the Charter if it be think necessary   we must look elsewhere   our distinguished SecretaryGeneral   speak in San Francisco on the twentyfifth anniversary of the signing ceremony   call eloquently on all Member States to   give the Charter a chance    to give it a go and let it succeed     the Foreign Minister of Brazil   in his thoughtful address which open this debate    remind we that   with all its shortcoming and frustration   the United Nations be the only forum in which we can still opt for life   peace and development   as he say   let we use the Organization and let we apply the Charter   we should take this advice to heart     finally   and above all   we must not lose hope in the United Nations   we must not let ourselves drift into cynicism   we should remember at all time the late Dag Hammarskjold s statement    it be not the Soviet Union nor indeed any ether big power who need the United Nations for their protection   it be ail the other   in this sense the Organization be first of all their organization

       "3     may I begin by express to Ambassador Hambro   on behalf of the delegation of Austria   our good wish on his election as President of this General Assembly     we derive great satisfaction from the knowledge that this twentyfifth session of the United Nations will be hold under the Presidency of a man whom we not only admire as an experienced diplomat   but whose background and personality be so germane to the problem and the respect of international law   this may be quite significant at a time when national and international system of law be expose to increase attack and hard test     as representative of a European State   we be also happy to see that this twentyfifth anniversary session of the General Assembly happen to be hold under a President from our continent   start with the first General Assembly of    which convene under the presidency of that european statesman of genuine greatness PaulHenri Spaak and up to this twentyfifth anniversary session   a chain of outstanding personality come from all continent have preside over our Assembly   the President of this session be continue this illustrious tradition     I also wish to use this opportunity to express the sincere gratitude of the austrian delegation to Mrs   Angie BrooksRandolph   President of last year s General Assembly     a tragic event of the first magnitude have cast a dark shadow on our deliberation   President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic die suddenly on Monday of this week   in he his own country have lose an outstanding leader and the world a statesman who   by opt for a ceasefire follow by negotiation   rekindle the hope of million for a peaceful solution of the Near East conflict   we bow our head to the memory of a great man and extend our heartfelt sympathy to the people of the United Arab Republic in their great bereavement     the twentyfifth anniversary of the United Nations   which come into be after the end of the Second World War out of a genuine desire to free future generation from the scourge of war   be an occasion to consider what have be achieve and also what have be leave undone so far   an occasion to examine our conscience and to ask whether each Member State have really make a due contribution to the peaceful cooperation of the people of the world   I believe that it should always be bear in mind that the United Nations can successfully exploit the possibility open to it by the Charter only within the boundary set for it by the will of all Member States   and especially by the great Powers     look back at the development of the last twentyfive year one be entitle to ask to what extent have we show respect for the fundamental principle of international law and act in the spirit of the Charter   have we   the States Members of this Organization   really refrain in our international relation from the use or the threat of force against the territorial integrity or the political independence of other States   have the Member States always settle international dispute by peaceful mean and in such a way as not to endanger international security and justice   have the principle be apply that no state should interfere in the domestic affair of another State   have the principle of the equality of sovereign States and their people and their right to self determination be observe   and   finally   have the States cite out in good faith the obligation assume under the United Nations Charter     we must acknowledge   regretfully   that there be a flagrant discrepancy between the present international situation and those principle of the Charter and of international law which should have govern friendly relation among States   while we make speech here   people be fight and die in SouthEast Asia and in the Middle East   horrible act of air piracy   kidnapping and murder of innocent hostage be increase in a frightening way   the rule of international law   the principle of the Charter and human right be trodden underfoot daily and real or imaginary wrong be avenge by new lawlessness     I believe that this situation   which be of grave concern   can be resolve only if we find our way back to that deep and sincere desire for peace which fill all the nation of the world at the end of the last great war   and if we make the principle of the United Nations Charter the guideline for our conduct   just as in the domestic life of a State   mutual tolerance must be exercise in relation between community   as advocate by Comenius the th anniversary of whose death be be commemorate this year when he say    no State receive internal peace as a free gift   it be the expression of mutual give and take   of self restraint   of freedom base on equal and inalienable right and the dignity inherent in all man   the same apply to external peace   it will not just drop into one s lap without mutual give and take   selfrestraint and continuous effort      Austria   as a permanently neutral state whose national security be closely link to international stability   be vitally interested in all measure conducive to the strengthening of international security   accordingly   we welcome the debate at the twentyfourth session of the General Assembly on the item entitle   strengthening of international security   and convey to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations our position and proposal on that item    to come close to that objective of international security   it be first necessary to strengthen the United Nations as the most important institution for the preservation of world peace and to support it in the fulfillment of its task   the current anniversary session of the General Assembly provide a welcome opportunity to that end      peace on our planet will be attainable only if each individual state make its contribution to that end by endeavor to solve   in the spirit of the Charter   all problem arise with its neighboring state and within its region     since Europe   too   be not free of such tension and since Austria have a natural interest in a detente   it welcome the recent signing of a treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union as an encouraging begin   it also welcome the proposal to hold a conference to deal with question of security and cooperation in Europe   in a series of bilateral talk with interested States   Austria have endeavor to make its contribution to the creation of a generally acceptable basis for such a conference   Austria have outline its position in a memorandum address to all interested States     a minimum of trust be a prerequisite for all cooperation and the foundation for the success of any conference   the good way to build trust remain the fulfillment of treaty and respect for United Nations resolution   in this connexion it be a source of great satisfaction for I to be able to report to this Assembly on a problem which   in accordance with two resolution of the General Assembly   it be possible to move appreciably close to a solution during the last year   namely   the question of South Tirol     by its resolution    XV   and    XVI   the General Assembly have call upon Austria and Italy to resume negotiation on the implementation of the Paris Agreement of   September    which regulate the status of the germanspeake population of the Province of Bozen and establish a system design to guarantee to the Germanspeaking inhabitant of the Province of Bozen   complete equality of right with the italianspeaking inhabitant   within the framework of special provision to safeguard the ethnical character and the cultural and economic development of the Germanspeaking element    the talk be to be resume with the objective of find a solution to all difference relate to the implementation of the aforementioned agreement     last year   after nine year of effort   Austria and Italy work out a proposal for a solution which have receive   on a democratic basis   the approval of the elect representative of the people both in Austria and Italy as well as that of the South tirolean minority   the two government have convey this information to the States Members of the United Nations through the SecretaryGeneral in document a   and a   of   July      while the propose solution could not be base on a reconciliation between the legal position of the party concern   it provide nevertheless for a number of step to be take by the austrian and italian side in accordance with a timetable call   calendar of operation    within its framework and by mean of a constitutional law   ordinary law   executive regulation to the constitutional law and administrative decree   Italy commit itself to grant a number of legislative and administrative right to the province of Bo wn the homeland of the South Tiroleans thus expand the autonomy of that minority     the administrative decree provide under this timetable of operation have already be issue   the constitutional law be introduce into the Chamber of Deputies by the italian Government at the beginning of this year and be now under parliamentary consideration   the ordinary law should be submit to the italian Parliament before the end of this year   it be our sincere hope   and we be encourage therein by the Government declaration of Prime Minister Colombo on   August    that the parliamentary procedure for the project legislation will not consume too much time   so that its positive political effect may not be impair by excessive delay     as soon as the measure enumerate and describe in detail in the official annex to the italian Government declaration of   December    which be note with approval by the Austrian Parliament at its meeting of   December    and which be to be incorporate in a Constitutional Law   ordinary law and executive regulation to the Constitutional Law   become legally valid in South Tirol   Austria will declare that it consider as terminate the dispute which be the subject of the aforementioned resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations     Hand in hand with the implementation of measure in favor of the South tirolean minority in Italy   an agreement between Austria and Italy will be sign and submit to the ratification procedure and   after completion of these step   will come into force   this will make the provision of chapter   of the European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes applicable   in the relation between Austria and Italy   to dispute concern the interpretation and implementation of bilateral agreement in force between the two party   also in those case where dispute refer to fact or situation prior to the come into force of the aforementioned european convention between the two States     I be happy to acknowledge that   through the new regulation envisage for autonomy in South Tirol   a cornerstone be lay for a renew and fruitful cooperation between the two neighboring country   Austria and Italy   the Austrian Government be firmly   sign in Strasbourg on   April   under the auspice    of the Council of Europe   resolve to honor its commitment under the propose solution   at the same time   it confidently trust that Italy will make its contribution to the further development of friendly and rewarding relation between our two country by a speedy implementation   in letter and spirit   of the measure envisage   and also by follow a policy of understanding in respect of the South Tirolean ethnic group   Austria be sincerely interested in such a development     notwithstanding the effort by European States to arrive at a lessening of tension and to achieve close cooperation   the overall political picture of our world remain clouded   it be an undeniable fact that it have not become possible to put an end to warfare in the Middle East and in SouthEast Asia   or even to reduce the hazard the situation in the Middle East present to world peace   there be no lack of earnest endeavor from various side   in particular one have to rate highly the effort deploy by the great Powers to reach a formula acceptable to all party for settle the difference in the IsraeliArab conflict   the ceasefire and the renew search for a political solution to the conflict through the interposition of the United Nations mediator   Ambassador Gunnar Jarring   be overshadow by the sanguinary battle fight in Jordan   in the long run   however   the only hope for a solution would seem to lie in a settlement of the deeply root difference among the people of the Middle East by peaceful mean   Austria be convince that the Security Council resolution of   November   point to a way that would lead to a peaceful coexistence of the people of that area   a region so rich in cultural heritage and economic potential   Austria be prepared to continue its contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in that area and be also willing   whenever it be deem desirable   to provide observer or contingent even on a large scale     the war in VietNam go on and in the course of this year have even spread over a wide area because of the hostility in Cambodia   while here   too   effort aim at a peaceful settlement and a deescalation of military action should not be overlook   we can not refrain from express this year again   our serious concern at the continuation of the armed conflict     we hope that in the face of the continue human suffering and of the apparent deadlock in this horrible war   all side will eventually realize that here too a political solution and the use of peaceful mean can alone lead to a settlement   a suitable basis for which may be provide by the Geneva Agreements of   and    we have to realize that all plan for the future would be pointless   that we would lack credibility unless we succeed in settle problem of this scope and urgency     among the grave problem confront we   I should now like to point with purpose to those occurrence which not only represent a retreat from the fundamental rule of a civilized world   but which may also become a serious threat to the maintenance of peace   I be refer to the increasingly frequent act of air piracy and bombing attempt against civil aircraft in flight   as well as to the abuse and even slaughter of innocent hostage to enforce political end   I agree entirely with SecretaryGeneral U Thant when he call such act savage and inhuman and ask for effective international measure to prevent the perpetration and spread of these crime     in the light of our interest in the strengthening of international security   Austria follow the development of the disarmament talk with the great attention   I should like to express here our satisfaction that the two superpower find themselves ready to engage in negotiation on the limitation of strategic weapon   the fact that the late phase of these talk be hold in Vienna underscore anew the relevance of a permanently neutral state as a venue for such meeting   may I express the hope that the continuation of these talk will lead to concrete agreement whereby the threat of an atomic devastation of our planet would be at least diminish   if not altogether remove     at the same time I should like to emphasize the significance of multilateral disarmament effort which have worldwide disarmament measure as their objective   the come into force of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons in march of this year be certainly an important step forward   Austria   one of the first country to ratify this Treaty   appeal to those state which have not yet decide to do so to accede to it   despite the perhaps not entirely balance commitment between the nuclear and the nonnuclear States   Austria also welcome the fact that important task relate to the implementation of the Treaty be refer to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna     the complexity of the question of disarmament be directly relate to the revolutionary progress in science and technology   it be therefore logical that in the last year the United Nations have increasingly direct its attention to the longrange problem which be closely link to this technical evolution   I be refer here mainly to the practical application of space technology which be likely to change our daily life in the future   I should also mention   in this context   the attempt to institute a legal system for outer space and the ocean floor and   last but not least   the effort of the United Nations to preserve the human environment     despite an encouraging start in the area of legal arrangement for outer space   a slowdown may now be observe in this work   nor have the effort to set forth a declaration of principle for the seabed   so far   achieve the desire goal   this immobility must be overcome because   not only in theoretical but also in practical term   legislative action of the United Nations in these two field appear to contribute constructively to the future evolution of the world Organization     the technological   scientific and also political development of the last decade have make the interdependence of human you all over the globe even clear   this be evident in the political and   perhaps even more so   in the economic field   accordingly   industrial States must take into account    n their economic policy   the interest of the develop country   the United Nations and its subsidiary agency on their part should carry out the technical preliminary work necessary for a well understanding of the increase need and also for the coordination and execution of the various program   the Second United Nations Development Decade   approve by the twentyfirst session of the General Assembly and design to reduce the gap between the poor and the rich by promote the economic growth of the develop country   thus acquire particular significance   Austria will make its contribution to the goal of this decade and within the limit of its economic possibility will in particular make every effort to achieve   during that period   a volume of development assistance equivalent to   per cent of its gross national product     the presence in Vienna of important United Nations institution   particularly the United Nations Industrial Development Organization   and the holding in our country of numerous international conference underline once again the importance which we attach to the Development Decade   in this regard I wish to point out that the Austrian Government incur very substantial expense to provide UNIDO with fully adequate working premise mainly through new construction and we be proud to note that our effort in this direction be reward by the appreciation express from all side   include the Secretary General     regard the establishment of a United Nations    city in Vienna   which would serve as headquarters for the organization already locate there   as well as those that would wish to move to Vienna in future   an international competition of urban architecture have now be complete   the project select by the jury be now be examine by the Austrian Government in respect of their feasibility   and it may be expect that a decision on the project to be adopt will be make   in consultation with IAEA and UNIDO   even before the end of this year   Austria hope that by provide the financial support for this undertaking it will make a further valuable contribution towards the attainment of the objective of the Development Decade     I should like now to point to two more subject which   in our view   deserve particular attention on the part of the United Nations   I be refer to the fact that the use and the significance of datum processing in economy   education   administration and science have grow to such an extent that individual States can no long   by themselves   keep pace with this development   at the same time a situation should be avoid in which   because of high technical capability   individual state or group of state acquire a monopoly in this important field   the Austrian Association for Data Processing therefore submit some time ago a memorandum to SecretaryGeneral U Thant   which contain a proposal for the setting up of a central service for the processing and exchange of datum within the United Nations framework and which   in addition to the processing of the material   would also have the task of carry out an objective evaluation of all the datum on the basis of unified standard   thus prevent possible manipulation     the second thought I want to submit be that   in view of the continuously increase demand on national administration and on the secretariat of international organization   the problem of the auditing of these administration acquire a grow significance   Austria be happy to be host in Vienna to the International Secretariat of the Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions   which have set itself the task of promote principle of efficient administrative control through periodic exchange of experience   in accordance with a wish often express by develop country a seminar have be plan within the framework of that Organization s activity   to be conduct in Austria in the spring of    with assistance from the United Nations Development Program   which will deal with state audit problem at the high level   with particular emphasis on problem peculiar to develop country     in conclusion   I should like to go back once again to the phenomenon of the increase act of violence occur both in international and national life   accord to art    paragraph   of the Charter   the primary purpose of the United Nations be to settle international dispute and situation which may lead to a breach of peace by peaceful mean and in conformity with the principle of justice and international law   it would therefore be correct to say that the United Nations be build on the principle of   peace through law      the external peace to be ensure in accordance with that principle necessarily imply internal peace within the member of the family of nation as its prerequisite   that internal peace can not exist   in the long run   inside a state which do not respect the fundamental right of the person   which be also consecrate by the Charter of the United Nations   human right and fundamental freedom can no long be exclusively regard today as the classic right which we may find in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of   December      the principle of the equality of all man have since be expand by the codify activity of the United Nations   aim at prevent all form of racial discrimination   discrimination base on the color of the skin or on ethnic origin   such as we find it today in particular in southern Africa   be therefore liable to compromise external peace   the austrian Government have repeatedly state that it reject the concept of apartheid   which be contrary to the Charter   just as it reject every other political concept base on racial   religious or ethnic discrimination   I wish to restate this position of ours most emphatically and to stress   in this context   that in the opinion of Austria   the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa   which be endorse by the twentyfourth General Assembly   point to a practicable way towards the implementation of the Declaration on decolonization adopt ten year ago     the development in southern Africa be the more alarming since the discriminatory policy   condemn by the whole world   be spread to an area which by virtue of decision of this Organization have be place under the direct responsibility of the United Nations   the inhabitant of Namibia must be give the right freely to determine their future   just as all the other people of the world     in connexion with this problem we welcome the decision of the Security Council reflect in its resolution      of   July    which request an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice regard   the legal consequence for States of the continue presence of South Africa in Namibia   notwithstanding Security Council resolution        one hope that the advisory opinion to be hand down by the International Court of Justice will bring this Organization one step near to the solution of the namibian problem     in this connexion   it would seem appropriate for I to say a few word about the International Court itself   we believe that the proposal submit to the General Assembly to review the role of the Court deserve close study   those proposal be design to expand the sphere of action of the Court   and in that context more emphasis could be place on the concept of the peaceful settlement of dispute   especially interesting be the idea of set up regional chamber of the Court which could be use for the settlement of dispute within a give region   to stress the significance which Austria attach to the role of the International Court of Justice   I should like to state here that the Federal Government of Austria have decide   during these last day   to introduce a bill in Parliament which would provide for the issuance of a declaration under Article    paragraph    of the Statute of the International Court of Justice   accord to which Austria will recognize the jurisdiction of the Court as   compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement   in relation to any other state accept the same obligation      I have focus my remark more specifically on the aspect of international security and the maintenance of law and order in the world   this in no way mean that we underrate the significance of other problem   I be   however   firmly convince that a firm rededication you all Member States to the principle of friendly relation and cooperation among nation would be an essential step to bring we near to peace and to the solution of all pende problem     we must learn from the past that peace   justice and progress form an indivisible whole and constitute as such the condition sine qua non for the survival of mankind

       "4     no doubt each of we   before come up to this rostrum   wonder about the usefulness or futility of the speech   must we still speak when our voice be drown out by the mournful cry of so many victim of the world s disorder   our reply be yes   provide that   in listen to each other   we become more deeply convinced of our responsibility   for our part   we shall not extol the success of the United Nations   nor shall we allow ourselves to be discourage by its failure   a worldwide order of peace and justice can not be build in   year     be it not important in itself that our Organization   conceive in a very different moment of history   have withstand the change work by a single quarter century     in    no one doubt that the United Nations be necessary   on the contrary   people want it to be effective     it seem to we that one thing should encourage we all   it be the fact that in our country   in mine as in may other   the great principle   of the Charter be impress themselves more and more on conscience and especially on the conscience of the young   on the one hand we see that in most of our country many conviction be crumble   but on the other hand we find strong support than exist   year ago for the five choice make by our States in    indeed there be   and particularly among the young member of our population   an immediate response to the duty to organize collective security   the duty to disarm   the duty to ensure the equitable distribution of good among all people   respect for human right   and the settlement by arbitration or judicial process of legal dispute between States     all these aim   in our country and in many other   be become more and more sacred   imperative and urgent   the failure to observe these principle grow more shocking   and we be therefore urge to hasten the time when these principle and duty will be fulfil throughout the world     our response to this expectation be twofold   as we see it   the aim of the United Nations must be tackle on all front and   whenever possible   at several level not only by the central institution of the United Nations   but also by numerous regional action     we do not propose the establishment of new institution   but rather the adaptation and enhancement of those we already have     first of ail we wish and I be say first of all to strengthen the central institution of the United Nations   especially for the purpose of achieve two of their main purpose   security and development     whatever contribute towards make the Security Council more effective will have our support   my country be one of the sponsor of the draft resolution on international security   submit in the First Committee   which   inter alia   contain specific proposal for strengthen the authority of the Council   but I fully realize that these proposal will not achieve their purpose unless   beforehand   all States Members of our Organization reaffirm their political will to accept and implement the decision of the Council   in accordance with Article   of the Charter     furthermore   in specific   limited field   the Charter delegate to the Security Council real power   and this   as we see it   foreshadow a world executive in a way   but here   should not the General Assembly support the Council   to that end   we would be in favor of the General Assembly   within the context of Article   of the Charter   pronounce itself on the action of the Security Council   and hence of its closely study the annual report of the Council     we also wish to emphasize the importance of the meeting of the Security Council provide for in paragraph   of Article   of the Charter   which should be hold in the course of the work of the present session of the General Assembly   we have strongly support that action in previous year and now reaffirm our support     so much for the field of security   the same hold true with regard to development   we believe that the time be come when a certain power of decision will have to be vest in a world executive   it be no long sufficient for the Economic and Social Council or the General Assembly simply to set development target   some poverty will not be avoid unless   in specific case   some authority can enforce the necessary action in time   for the purpose of restore peace   do not the Charter confer such power on the Security Council   and sometimes the Council exercise they   the same need exist where hunger or underdevelopment be involve     accordingly   we believe that we be face with the problem of the exercise of the central authority of the United Nations and of strengthen this Organization     of course   the question of strengthen the authority of the United Nations also embrace the question of its universality   we welcome the fact that in a quarter of a century the sovereignty of so many formerly dependent territory have be recognize and their admission to membership in the United Nations guarantee it   such be the irreversible trend of decolonization   but the problem of universality present itself in another way   some people be represent here only in part or not at all   their absence be not conducive to peace or to peaceful relation between States   the time be not very far off   we believe   when we will be able to adopt an attitude more consistent with our principle   to achieve this   we must overcome the difficulty which still persist   especially with regard to China     in this particular case   my country have consistently urge   for five year   a solution that would enable the representative of the Government of the People s Republic of China a State which we recognize to occupy the seat which belong to China in the General Assembly and in the Security Council   this solution can not jeopardize the right of the representative of the Government of the Republic of Taiwan to continue to enjoy the protection of our Charter   and therefore to participate in the work of the United Nations   this be   we believe   the only possibility   until a peaceful settlement enable the dispute between these two chinese government to be compose   we also believe that the peaceful settlement of that dispute would thereby be facilitate     my country regret that a large number of States have inform we that they do not yet share our view   and we therefore do not wish to express it this year in the form of a draft resolution   but   on the other hand   so far   no one have convince we that any other attitude would be both more just and more consistent with the Charter   we shall continue our consultation with other government in seek the urgent solution which this important problem demand     we therefore attach the great importance to strengthen the central power of the United Nations and to its universality   but we hold it to be equally true that the purpose of the Charter can be successfully achieve   although in part   by mean of regional arrangement or organization   derive from the spontaneous action of country group together in a give area one action do not exclude the other   one action add to the other   the one aid the other     the idea be hardly revolutionary   it be suggest in many part of the Charter and it have already be put into effect in part but in our opinion   at this time in history   it deserve further reflection and a new impetus   the reason for this effort can   we think   be formulate in a few proposal     let we make use of this need   which have become evident and be relatively recent   which compel most States to have recourse to interState   organization in order to solve their economic   social   communication   supply   market   cultural   scientific and defense problem   which today separate nation can as a rule no long master by themselves     this necessity for interdependence which be relatively recent   I repeat have create the need today for new regional link of solidarity   these be natural   they be become more and more closely knit   each be form differently by a complex of historical and geographical factor   similarity of human environment   identical need and aspiration   relate political regime and philosophy   we believe th t we must make use of this natural movement     we must therefore imbue these new institution with the spirit of the Charter and   in each case   examine whether they can not constitute   in turn   an initial framework which encompass the purpose of the United Nations and try to achieve they first in a regional context   perhaps some obstacle which impede the power of decision of the Security Council might now be offset by this method     the regional organization   too   will   of course   remain incomplete and partly prevent from fulfil their objective     but if the purpose of the United Nations be thus pursue from the ground to the top and from top to bottom   if the complementarity of action be ensure and   if   of course   the world body still have the last word in the event of conflict policy   then we can hope for a great measure of overall success in pursue the purpose of the Charter     those be the reason which   in the light of experience   prompt we to cooperate eagerly I be speak of Belgium in the world organization and in their decentralize activity and also to participate actively in our region   Europe   in promote link of regional solidarity and interdependence     that will provide a well understanding of some of the attitude adopt by my country with regard to the present item and   first of all   I turn to the problem of security     the more than   States which share the territory of Europe can not forget that in the past   year they have unleash more war than the other continent   and that two of they have set the world on fire   as if this be not enough   a cold war have be divide they for the past quarter of a century   why have this new situation of conflict not lead to a third world war   because   we believe   very soon and very fortunately bond of solidarity and interdependence begin to create balanced situation   certain transnational grouping in Europe which   due to the cohesion they have acquire and that will be develop far   make possible today the effort gradually to reduce tension and then to foster understanding     we have therefore ask ourselves whether   some day   security arrangement of the kind provide for in Article   of the Charter might bring about and guarantee harmony in the territory of the whole of Europe through the establishment of rule and instrument of agreement   conciliation and arbitration of dispute   here it must be make quite clear that such arrangement can be no substitute for our exist economic solidarity and I be refer to the European Economic Communities or for the exist defense organization that be   the Atlantic Alliance but they should supplement they   similarly   if a security agreement for the whole of Europe be to be conclude some day   nor would it replace the task of the Security Council   but would remain subordinated to it through the link provide for in Article   of the Charter     finally   let we say it   a regional organization for the security of the whole of Europe can not be achieve so long as there be no political agreement on Berlin   no rule accept you all on the real equality of States   and so long as the principle of noninterference in the affair of other be not uphold in practice   event of only too recent memory show that transitional step be necessary to temper power politic by establish collective security   it be therefore necessary   in our opinion   to seek to have such regional security agreement for Europe   not as an immediately obtainable objective   but as an ultimate end to be reach only step by step     it be on the road to european regional security that the time be come when effort must be make to endeavor to achieve the first intermediate objective which would in themselves have farreache implication   let the bilateral agreement on economic and social cooperation between country with different system become multilateral   let we seek to have the covenant renounce the use of force   such as the one recently sign by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics   apply to Europe as a whole     but for such intermediary agreement to be really credible   the negotiation themselves should at the same time make it possible to establish at least the principle and general outline of a gradual and parallel reduction in regional armament in Europe   both those station there and national armament   and that lead we to the second problem   disarmament     what purpose do it really serve to declare solemnly that we renounce the use of force   if we continue to pile up the instrument of force   it follow that the renunciation of force and the reduction of armament be two indivisible element     certainly the problem of disarmament have already be raise at the world level   but since we want the come decade to be that of disarmament   it would be worth while to pursue this aim at several level   the negotiation of the   at Geneva have bear some fruit   the bilateral socalle SALT negotiation between the United States and the Soviet Union do not seem to be ineffective     but what can and should Europe do   Europe which harbor so many tactical and conventional mean of destruction   should it take regional step to disarm   for a long time now Belgium have strongly believe that it should   and be prepared to participate in such negotiation   in which the United States and Canada would of necessity have to be party too   we hope that such negotiation will be possible as soon as the practical and wellknown condition for the ratification in Bonn of the GermanSoviet Treaty have be meet   and provide nothing else transpire to darken this horizon   then the active preparation of initial conference on european security could be organize   we will contribute   as in the past   to this first approach to regional security     the second area in which central and regional action can be combine without be merge   but complement each other   be development     we have speak about the Disarmament Decade   it will also be the Development Decade   the two be not unrelated   the strategy for the Second Development Decade have already be discuss at length and formulated   and in this context the volume and term of the financial aid for development be particularly noteworthy     that be why Belgium be happy to be able to announce that its total aid will exceed   per cent of its gross national product in    as in previous year   moreover   it wish to stress that its public aid rise   per cent in    and   per cent in    which place it fourth among the industrialized country   this public aid will far increase in    by   per cent     lastly   and above all   the belgian Government   mindful of the need and hope of the develop country   decide on   September    a few day ago   to place before Parliament a Program under which public aid would in   reach the figure of    per cent of that year s gross national product   this decision be a milestone in our policy   but its scope will be very limited unless it form part of a joint effort by the industrialize country     as we know very well   a common effort should not be focus only on the financing of development   it should encompass trade policy   a commodity price policy and support for the develop country s own effort in all area   especially that of regional cooperation and integration   this will in all likelihood require revision and adaptation of the process of world discussion     we believe furthermore that here again regional initiative can   through individual arrangement with certain develop country   add a dimension and a form of particularly effective mutual cooperation   I be think of the european community which   through the Yaounde Convention and the Arusha Declaration of January   and through aid to associated european country   make a contribution which   in some field   supplement and increase the effect of bilateral assistance     as regard Latin America   we view with sympathy the effort at progressive integration of the States of that part of the world   and we particularly welcome the spirit which   at the last meeting of the Special Commission for latin american coordination in July   motivate the Buenos Aires Declaration on the problem of relation with the European Economic Communities     in turn Belgium hope that the European Com munite   as they develop and expand   will be able to give Western Europe a new image   it will not be one of hegemony   it can not be one of neutrality   it will not be one of dependency   what   then   would be the attitude of Europe   in the process of unification   to the world   none other than one of intensive cooperation in the development of the southern hemisphere     today we must make provision for the economic and social restoration and rehabilitation of the region affect by the conflict in the Middle East   in that particular case my country be well aware that no real solution will be forthcoming as long as the palestinian refugee have no home nor the economic mean for their development     Belgium announce that it will participate in any european plan for rehabilitate the devastate area which will enable those refugee to settle in a stable and happy environment   we have submit to the european agency the plan draw up for this purpose by a Committee head by the President of the belgian Senate   once formulate   a Program of european cooperation would help the party to the conflict in their search for peace     on a more immediate and completely bilateral level   in swift response to the move appeal of our President and of the SecretaryGeneral   the belgian Government immediately decide   a few day ago   to make a very substantial contribution in aid for the many victim of the recent event in Jordan     more generally   I can not speak of the conflict in the Middle East without once again reaffirm the belgian Government s wholehearted support for all diplomatic effort aim at ensure the swift and full implementation of the Security Council s resolution of   November     unfortunately   three year have already go by since the essential condition for a political settlement of the Middle East question be lay down   we venture to hope that both the spirit and the letter of the ceasefire agreement of   August last   which we welcome as a happy event   will be respect by the party concern   we be anxious to see the early resumption of the talk initiate by Ambassador Jarring     we have just deal with subject of collective security   disarmament and cooperation for development   and we note that the convergence of action at the world level and of regional initiative could bring close the time when the purpose of our Charter will be more effectively fulfil     similar thought come to mind too in connexion with human right   economic and social cooperation and international justice     true   when we speak about the protection of the human person   it would be impossible to guarantee safety from certain evil practice only through international agreement or regulation   and I have in mind here particularly the present crime of hijacking and the detention or execution of diplomat   in regard to the former   my country will put forward its suggestion at the diplomatic conference to be hold in December at the Hague and   for the international protection of diplomat   consul and minister   it advocate the urgent convening of an ad hoc diplomatic conference     but when we envisage a more general approach to the question of respect for human right   here again we find an example of case where regional action can supplement that of our General Assembly   we recall that in   we draw up here   for the whole world   a Universal Declaration of Human Rights     but we can go far in the definition and protection of human right when regional community of States allow themselves to be motivate by a stable democratic conscience which be express therein   eighteen european country do so in    by draw up the European Charter of Human Rights and   in addition   by set up a european court on human right to which individual can have recourse when their right be challenge   several States   include Belgium   in the past already feel it an honor to amend their national legislation at the request of the Court to bring it into line with the decision of that Court     the same will apply to economic and social cooperation   the United Nations already have instrument of regional cooperation   it be in the regional economic commission that the idea of integration be bear   which take shape in Latin America and be strive to emerge in Africa   it be on their initiative that development bank be found   it be they who launch numerous project in the most varied field from industry to agriculture   and from natural resource to transportation     nevertheless   we would like those commission henceforth to play an even great role   so as to achieve the goal of the Second Development Decade   especially in the formulation of plan and the evaluation of progress     as far as the Economic Commission for Europe be concern   it already play a lead role in coordinate the effort make   with a view to improve goodneighborly relation among European States   as we read in resolution    XX    in this context or elsewhere   we think that in Europe the time have come to embark on a frank and thorough review of relation between the grouping of the market economy country and the Stateeconomy country     the last subject in regard to central action and regional action be that of international justice   indeed   in that field we also see that in some case regional initiative or action be possible   that be describe in Article   of the Charter which advocate the settlement of dispute between state by way of good office   mediation   conciliation and arbitration   that Article provide that those action can be carry out by regional agency   the Organization of African Unity have establish this type of machinery under the Charter   and we believe this to be a good thing     true   the International Court of Justice    the supreme tribunal in legal dispute and must   in the final analysis   guarantee the universality of international law   however   here again we can not forget that States party to regional legal dispute may   by virtue of the Statutes of the Court itself   Article    paragraph    ask that chamber be form for deal with a particular case   for such case   and if the question of reactivate the International Court of Justice be look into further   as request by the United States   Belgium will submit to it the question whether   in particular case and on very precisely determined occasion   regional ad hoc chamber could be form   while at the same time uphold the universal character of the United Nations and the universality of international law     my country have not be develop an abstract thesis today nor have it claim that regional initiative be some kind of panacea for the world   we be merely convinced that the spirit of the Charter can and must manifest itself in many place   and that we must not expect everything from initiative at the world level   nor of course can we expect everything from regional initiative   however   if they supplement one another   we may find herein a source of progress or initiative

       "7503  seventy year have pass since the establishment of the United Nations   People live differently now   many change have take place and many reform have be effect   it be time that we reform the United Nations as well   I call on the President to speed up this process during his mandate   perhaps no other session in the history of the General Assembly have come at a more opportune time   last year see many new development   Negotiations   which be unimaginable before   be start to end the embargo on Cuba   an agreement be reach to lift sanction on Iran   we recognize those who take part in make these historic decision and encourage they to see these change through to completion   this be very much in line with the policy my country have pursue for a number of decade   the world of today do not resemble the world of yesterday   and none of we can remain indifferent to this fact   our use to be a bipolar world   divide into blocs   we do not thrive because the pole be violently     a   pv      oppose to one another and have access to the most dangerous weapon the world possess at the time   but we be also not do well in a world with one power that carry out diplomacy by issue threat   oblivious to the concern of all other   include those of the United Nations   Peoples and States attend to their own interest and be thereby expose and open to extremist religious fanatic   give rise to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and other extremist movement   these terrorist group now threaten million of people and have create a negative image of Islam   the religion on whose behalf they profess to act   the two key element of law and ethic be once key in international relation and politic   United States President Woodrow Wilson be a staunch advocate   while the great serbian poet Njego   express it in verse of the Mountain Wreath in the following way   along his path who maketh might his right rise stench of inhuman cruelty      as Wolf doth on the Sheep impose his might   so tyrant lord it over feebler fellow   but foot to place upon the Tyrant s neck   to bring he to the consciousness of right    this of all human duty be most sacred today   however   legal and ethical factor be essentially be eclipse in international politic   not infrequently   unlawful and exceedingly immoral action be be take   purportedly for ethical and legal reason   this happen most often when a clear legal norm that brook no exception    such as the need for the Security Council to take a decision   for instance    stand in the way of a major power achieve its geopolitical goal   International law   therefore   and the moral tenet underpin a legal norm and its implementation   be deeply in crisis today   there be ample evidence of this   include the most recent largescale crisis   some call it a migrant crisis   other refer to it as another wave of people migrate for various reason   what worry we   though   be that those who think that effort should be intensify in the hope of restore peace quickly and easily and promote economic progress for all    develop country   in particular    be few and far between   we ought to look each other in the eye and assess the past year with an open mind   we ought to announce what have be achieve in our country   some of we ought to ask themselves if their action help humankind or threaten the future of our child   can we still begin our speech with   we   the people of the United Nations    be we any close to peace and prosperity or be we rush   with blindfold on   towards another    which see the start of a major world tragedy that last six year and whose consequence we shall never be able to erase   some of the mighty and powerful seem to believe that the world economic crisis do not do enough to terrify our child and their parent   they continue to use highly sophisticated weapon to drive people from their home and country and thrust they   in fear for their life   into the turmoil of migration   journey thousand of kilometre in a world without food   water or electricity   the responsibility for these development lie not with those who struggle to fight poverty and create condition in their country conducive to a dignified human life   or with Serbia   which have open soup kitchen in order to give many their only daily meal   it lie with those who have much   whether Godgiven or gain by exploit other   it lie with those who spend more on arm than all the world s poor country together spend on food   it lie with all of we   because we can not contemplate sustainable development without accept our share responsibility to tackle one of the world s major challenge    eradicating or at least alleviate poverty   I often wonder how parent can look their child in the eye as they tell they that school and learning be important for their future and a normal life   and try to convince they that they will have food on their plate once they finish school and acquire learn   we do not learn when we live in fear   have nothing to eat or be threaten by disease   when our parent be unemployed or we face the threat of a terrible war   those here represent the rich and powerful should think about that as they put their child to bed in a warm room at night and make important decision during the day   be profit and political or military superiority really worth so much that we no long feel the suffering of other but rather let baser instinct take over   peace and prosperity can not be a privilege for the people of certain country alone   every man and woman on planet Earth have a right to they   that        a   PV   be why we hold out a help hand in our quest to achieve the goal of the   Agenda for Sustainable Development   resolution     through share action aim at create a well future for humankind   base on principle that can ensure progress and prosperity for all   sustainable development be clearly a concept accept by most of the world   it postulate a global economy link every region of the world on a basis of trust   ethic   equality and support   as well as a comprehensive approach to manage development by analyse and assess the effort of government and business   all management   however   require that certain rule be establish   and the question therefore be   who will establish the rule and where   can individual   or group of individual   foresee all possible future event and development   and be it possible to control those event and development at all   be we simply establish a new global power centre   oblivious to the individual specific of state or group of States   an organization that have only one solution to all problem   what can we do about the fact that some of the goal do not correspond to some country   specific situation   we must understand that we can not control everyone s life even if we think it may be risky to leave thing up to their free will   major change in the way we live demand that we allow time to adjust to ensure that basic value do not collapse   today   the world be extraordinarily interconnect in miraculous   virtual way   information be exchange and people and good move at unprecedented speed   but the people themselves have never be so alienate   in huge city   amid million   people die alone   individual   States and international organization become alienated   there be many reason for this   increasingly   relation among States be base on the more powerful   affluent and develop impose their will on other   we hope that our new era will usher in a new beginning   a new way of thinking   whose essence will be   as it should   in the good interest of people and their immediate and large community   we all understand that this be not easy to achieve   for modern communication can be use to impose a way of thinking aim at implement idea that be not in the interest of the majority   modern man s urge to conform and daily struggle to meet ever great demand   along with the spectre of unemployment and hardship in later life   undermine his resolve to resist increasingly evident violation of basic human right   the world today be tragically divide between a few enormously rich individual and a majority who live outside the boundary of human dignity   the twentyfirst century threaten to be an age in which some country accumulate and concentrate enormous individual wealth and the rest be consign to poverty and uncertainty   among those wealthy individual be also an entirely new generation of privileged director who   unjustifiably and immorally   be pay far more than their employee   it seem   however   that the number of those willing to protest this phenomenon have be grow to a point where their demand may have to be accede to   I urge everyone to work together to help to achieve an equitable distribution of the world s asset and resource   we continue to talk noncommittally about another major challenge   that of climate change   as if its consequence be not patently evident everywhere   and as if we do not see that they be exacerbate the friction cause by the already high level of inequality in the world   in a wakeup call of sort   the consequence of our past and current action now have the great effect on the weak of we   the country that be still undeveloped industrially and struggle to provide their citizen with a well life   most develop country account for just a fraction of global warming   they must be give the opportunity to grow their economy under the same condition that have already enable other country to prosper   even though their greenhouse gas emission may be high than the rich would like   we must develop technology that can enable develop country to develop while be as environmentally responsible as possible   rather than use concern about greenhouse gas emission and global warming as pretext to allow their industry to stagnate   there be moral reason   too   for ensure that country develop   Politicians should be task with provide full support to scientific activity   on the one hand   and harmonize and coordinate response to climate change and extreme weather situation   on the other   adapt and prepare national and social response to potential scenario   include worstcase scenario   should be our most basic and important goal   Serbia s Government and scientific institution   in full compliance with the relevant international document   first and foremost among they the United     A   pv      Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change   UNFCCC   and the Kyoto Protocol   will continue to contribute to the activity of the United Nations and other organization   primarily through european and regional initiative on climate monitoring and reduce the negative effect of climate change   Serbia welcome the forthcoming twentyfirst session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC to be hold in Paris later this year   we intend to support and make a full contribution to consideration of this important issue   we will continue to work together with other as a team and an active participant   in hope that scientist will come up with clear answer and irrevocable proof as soon as possible   while politician support they and implement speedy   effective solution   we can hope for a well future only if we overcome problem such as hunger   war and disease   Serbia have therefore actively participate in peacekeeping operation all over the world and have make every effort to train and equip grow number of its officer and soldier to take part in such important assignment   in that regard   this year Serbia s chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have be universally commend   include by those currently in conflict situation   I should also add that Serbia have be a candidate country of the European Union for more than three year now and have continue to take decisive step to harmonize its system and practice with European Union standard   at the same time   Serbia have also continue to maintain its cooperation and friendship with Russia and China   a State be make up of its territory   its people   its language and its cultural heritage   Serbia be the only country in Europe that in addition to see part of its territory seize   its people expel and their murder and the socalled harvesting of their organ go unpunished   have now have to deal with attack on its cultural heritage under the protection of UNESCO   here I recall that in March    in the face of only sporadic opposition from the Kosovo Force   KFOR    Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija destroy numerous Christian Orthodox church   other church building   convent   bell tower and monastery library and archive   usually by set fire or explosive device   that be only the brutal and effective perpetuation of the damage and destruction of over   Orthodox sanctuary perpetrate since the arrival of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the KFOR in June    in that period   the albanian terrorist systematically destroy the spiritual and cultural heritage of the serbian people in Kosovo and Metohija   their centurieslong existence there be evince in the many monastery and church whose foundation be lay before the ninth century and represent serbian deed etch in stone   the testimony of the serbian presence in Kosovo and Metohija   at the thirtyfirst session of its General Conference   UNESCO confirm that a crime against a cultural heritage be commit in Kosovo and Metohija   in the small territory of Kosovo and Metohija   UNESCO have register   highly valuable cultural monument of the serbian people   as clearly define by UNESCO standard   as many as   monument from the Middle Ages have be identify as a part of european and world heritage in which humankind can take pride and honour   specifically   they serve our pride and honour   these invaluable and unique work of art and architecture have survive five century of Ottoman rule   the Balkan Wars and the first and second World Wars   yet   there they be   in    be savagely desecrate and destroy   bury and plough over   as though that undertaking be a part of preparation   design with meticulous precision   to coincide with the unilateral declaration of independence of the Republic of Kosovo   an event that ensue four year after the barbaric destruction of the patrimony of Serbia s christian culture and civilization   not only serbian   but also european culture and the world s collective memory be preserve in Kosovo and Metohija   represent an important human civilizational achievement on planet Earth   it be therefore important that Serbia   as a member of UNESCO   continue to be the keeper of this cultural treasure   which belong both to Serbia and to the world   in an attempt to falsify history    unfortunately with the support of a certain number of country    Albania have submit   on behalf of the Pristina Administration   a request to UNESCO that the serbian heritage be declare Kosovar    that be   albanian   those who strategically destroy monastery with the aim of marginalize the importance of Kosovo and Metohija for the Serbs and of establish a new ethnic and cultural identity for Kosovo and Metohija on the ashe of the history of other   would be reward in that way   how be it possible that arsonist and destroyer   with goal that clearly go you all the ethical norm and establish rule on which UNESCO be found         A   PV   be now try to project themselves as guardian and protector   should that request be accept nonetheless   a dangerous precedent would be set and the door would be open for the legitimization of violence against the national   cultural and religious identity of any people anywhere   by defend the right of Serbia to preserve and proudly present its identity and cultural heritage   as it have do for the past   century   by prevent the unscrupulous dispossession of one s heritage and its attribution to somebody else   we be defend the underlie principle of international law and human justice   as well as those on which UNESCO be found   I therefore call on all head of State not to allow the serbian people to have its soul excise   its essence usurped and its monastery in Kosovo and Metohija   its spiritual backbone   declare the cultural heritage of the albanian people there   in short   that be neither the truth nor a historical and scientific fact   it be not justice   Peoples do not acquire history and civilization by snatch century of the existence of other or by bribe   with Judas   silver   those to whom the history of other mean nothing and who would stand by indifferently if the spiritual and cultural root of a people    in this case of we Serbs    be remove from the area from which they have be expel   the United Nations must preserve its credibility and stand up to the injustice and evil that Serbia would suffer if the Organization acquiesce to that undertaking   I be certain that those gather here   as responsible and honourable person of State   will stand up against the injustice and wrong that would be inflict upon Serbia and could have a domino effect on other nation and States   Serbia be talk to the representative of the Administration in Pristina   it will fulfil all its obligation under Security Council resolution      and all its obligation under the agreement reach in Brussels   but it will never   ever recognize the independence of part of its territory   the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija   to which its very existence be connect   the problem of the mass migration from the Middle East be the great challenge of our time   we can not analyse the cause and or identify those directly and indirectly responsible for the migrant crisis here and now   it be an issue of paramount importance and should be address at an international forum that would bring together prominent leader and eminent scholar and scientist   that be the good way to assess the situation objectively   provide an answer and propose a solution to that complex problem   the humanitarian disaster face the world be only a consequence of the crisis that have shake Syria for the past four year   all along without an adequate response from the international community   without access to common funding   the situation of Serbia be perhaps more difficult than that of the other country of the old continent   despite its difficult economic situation   Serbia be make every effort to provide decent condition and accommodation for refugee   however   if the international community   and the European Union above all   fail to make concrete effort to solve the problem   a humanitarian catastrophe of an even large scale would threaten SouthEast Europe   the consequence be impossible to foresee   but they would surely affect not only Europe   but the whole world as well   as regard the number of asylum seeker in the Republic of Serbia     person arrive in Serbia between   January and   September   and only   have submit asylum request   I would like to draw attention to the alarming practice of some government that have erect wire and razor fence to ghettoize the asylumseeker flee war and destitution   such an attitude run counter to the   Convention relate to the Status of Refugees and the proclaim solidarity of the States member of the European Union with migrant   it also aggravate the situation in country that respect international law and treat the individual strike by calamity humanely   the government of certain States Members of the United Nations behave as if they have never abandon the ideology that prevail before the end of the Second World War   thereby destroy the fragile stability in the Balkans that be achieve through hard work and dedication   to which Serbia contribute the most   my country have have to cope with a deep economic crisis since    Refugees   therefore   can not expect to secure much more than their personal safety in Serbia   we will provide it to they irrespective of the fact that certain country also intervene against people live in serbian territory   our care for humankind and our empathy for those in need   as well as our resolve to give those people what we may not need as urgently as they do at the moment   will not diminish   our border be open to receive they and to let they through   we need no law for that because that be the way we be   Serbia be     a   pv      not a member of the European Union   but it consistently implement the proclaim principle of solidarity   a fundamental value and the supposedly unconditional mainstay of the Union itself   I do not understand this selfishness   and sometimes even the hatred towards those who have nothing that some individual have come to nurture   if the rapid pace with which the leader of some country be lose their cool and composure be any clue   the situation can only deteriorate   we therefore need a comprehensive plan that would have to be implement within the short possible time   without such a plan   migrant will be leave altogether at the mercy of human smuggler   Passivity and the increasingly inhumane treatment of migrant open a market for smuggler   the sequence of catastrophe that would ensue in such a case   from the Mediterranean to the British Isles   would be tragic   and the tragedy in which over   people die would be remember as just one sad link in that sorry chain   even though it be not directly involve in the conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia in the s   start and stagemanage in a similar way to the conflict in Syria   Serbia be label guilty   a resolution be even recently submit to the Security Council to stigmatize the Serbs as an example of a genocidal people   although such a characterization of any people in the world be unjustifiable   the attempt fail   as member of the Security Council be aware of the true intention and desire of the initiator   as well as the possible catastrophic consequence   what kind of genocidal criminal be we   be it the image impart by the footage of migrant in Serbia   undaunted and unworried about the reaction of our people and authority   unlike elsewhere in the region   or be it the image of a hospitable people with a kind heart   have serbian citizen change   they have not   the people of Serbia of all ethnicity have   now and in the past   be humane and hospitable   as well as good neighbour   in addition to refugee from Syria   Afghanistan   Pakistan and Iraq   Serbia host hundred of thousand of refugee and displace person from the territory of the former Yugoslavia   they be preponderantly Serbs   but include also Bosniaks   Croats   Roma and other   some of these people have go to third country   while other continue to live in Serbia   we be still face with the consequence of these migration as they have alter the demographic   social and other structure of our country and society   then and now   my country have not have much to offer to these destitute people who leave their home   it have share the little it have   Serbia expect the United Nations Member States to act responsibly and humanely   we should all bear in mind that this situation will have global consequence   Civilization be at a crossroad   Europe be go through serious travail and tribulation   now be the time for it to show if it still be the standardbearer in the implementation of human right and the

without a resolution of the palestinian question   a solution be urgent   Otherwise   if we delay   in the next decade we may no long have a piece of land to justify the two State solution   the historic seventieth anniversary of the United Nations present an opportunity to reflect on the structure and working of the Organization   significantly   this year mark the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the World Summit Outcome   resolution     in    which discuss reform of the United Nations   a number of significant decision on reform have be successfully implement since that Summit   they include the follow   the replacement of the Human Rights Commission with a more effective Human Rights Council   the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission as a subsidiary body of both the General Assembly and the Security Council   the reform and streamlining of the United Nations management system   the mainstreaming of gender equality through the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women   UNWomen   and the membershipdriven responsibility to protect and to assist population face genocide   crime against humanity   war crime and ethnic cleansing   we welcome that notable progress   however   almost no progress have be make on the commitment also make by head of State and Government in   to the early reform of the Security Council   it be unacceptable and unjustifiable that more than   billion people in the african continent be still exclude from permanent membership in the key decisionmake structure of the United Nations   the Security Council   a continent with a small population than Africa be represent by three country on the Security Council as permanent member   that be unfair   the United Nations can not pretend that the world have not change since    we be no long colony   we be free   independent sovereign state   we welcome the fact that the push for the reform of the Security Council come from Africa have have an impact and have give some impetus to the intergovernmental negotiation process that have be look at the reform   we will continue work with progressive States towards the expansion of representation   another critical matter that need attention be the selection of the SecretaryGeneral   who be appoint by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council   a review of that process be necessary so as to enable more meaningful participation on the part of the General Assembly in the process   the President have identify human right   governance   the rule of law   and the gender aspect of the work of the United Nations as important area of focus for the seventieth session of the General Assembly   we have to build upon the initial work undertake in the development of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in   to enhance protection in area such as racism   discrimination against woman and the promotion of the right of the child and the right of people with disability   we also believe that the United Nations human right system   especially its Human Rights Council   should ensure a balance between civil and political right   on the one hand   and economic   social and cultural right   include the right to development   on the other   the Human Rights Council must also be see as an independent and impartial mechanism for the entrenchment of a human right culture throughout the world   it should avoid the pitfall of its predecessor   the Commission on Human Rights   which be beset by politicization and be catch up in the divide between develop and develop country   this year also mark   year since the adoption of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination   the year   also mark   year since

meeting that will take place on the margin of the General Assembly to review the progress make in counter terrorism in the Middle East and North Africa   we wish to emphasize that the Security Council must take into account the view of the african continent and its subregional organization when deal with conflict in Africa in future   the current situation in Libya and the Sahel region be a direct consequence of the failure of some member of the Council to heed inform counsel from the African Union   the norm of responsibility to protect be abuse for narrow political interest that have nothing to do with the fundamental aspect of the prevention of mass atrocity   the current refugee crisis in Europe be   sadly   the direct result of the militarization of civilian unrest   which include the massive arming of civilian and opposition group in Libya   Syria and other affected country   that kind of problem be a deliberately man make problem   and it be critical that   in discuss violent extremism and terrorism in part of Africa and the Middle East   we look into the root cause of the problem and not just the symptom   also require our serious reflection be the regime change doctrine

suffer   as eloquently express in the General Assembly and globally   we commend the United Nations for the key role that it have play in peacekeeping and urge that resource be prioritize for this core role of the United Nations   especially in Africa   the failure of the party to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach an agreement at the   Review Conference    in the year that mark   year since the first atomic bomb be detonate in Japan    be a major setback to our commitment to rid the world of weapon of mass destruction   especially nuclear weapon   there can be no safe hand where nuclear weapon be concern   the humanitarian consequence of a possible detonation of a nuclear weapon   whether intentional or accidental   will be catastrophic for humankind   we welcome the recent agreement reach on the iranian nuclear programme and the recognition of the right of Iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy   the seventieth session of the General Assembly have see the adoption of the post development agenda   the outcome document represent a victory for the develop world   as it affirm that the   Agenda for Sustainable Development   resolution     should build on the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals   Additionally   while the   Agenda be universal in its scope in that the Sustainable Development Goals adopt apply to both develop and develop country   there be also a clear recognition of the principle of common but differentiated responsibility and capability   the Agenda also contain a specific goal on achieve gender equality

       "7505  I would like to begin by thank the SecretaryGeneral and by express my gratitude for the convening of this important session   at which we mark the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations   I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate his Excellency Mr   Mogens Lykketoft on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session   I be confident that   come as he do from the great country of Denmark   he will preside over our meeting with great success   I would also like to pay tribute to his Excellency Mr   Sam Kutesa of the Republic of Uganda for successfully preside over the Assembly at its previous session   I be profoundly grateful for the opportunity to deliver my first address to this gathering of world leader   I should recall that   almost a year ago   my country find itself at a crossroad follow the demise   on   October    of our fifth President   Mr   Michael Chilufya Sata    may his soul rest in peace   I be elect President of the Republic of Zambia in the subsequent election   which take place on   January   build on my country s impeccable record in the area of democracy and good governance   the election be describe as transparent   peaceful   free and fair   reflect our commitment to internationally accept standard for peaceful change of government and popular participation in shape a country s destiny   I would therefore like to thank the people of Zambia for be true champion of democracy   as we meet today   I also feel duty bind to thank the international community for its unflinche solidarity during that very challenging time of the past year   this year be an important one for the General Assembly   as we commemorate the   year of existence of the United Nations   in our deliberation   therefore   it be imperative that we take stock of the collective success as well as the challenge of the past seven decade   in order to improve the performance of this noble Organization   I be optimistic that the seventieth session will set a tone for the future and meet the expectation of the international community as a whole   Zambia be proud to be part of the global endeavour to foster the mandate of the United Nations to promote peace   security and respect for human right and to ensure progress in development for all   we be concern   however   that the gear for advance the three pillar of the Charter of the United Nations be move at a very slow pace   which have the potential to negate the gain we have achieve so far   it be therefore important that we enhance our concerted effort to address area of concern   we have just adopt the world s quintessential development blueprint in the form of the   Agenda for Sustainable Development   resolution      centre on humankind   the environment and the creation of peaceful society   those core element will guide its implementation   support by the principle of leave no one behind   I have be encourage by the focus on development that have characterize the global discourse in recent year   as the   Agenda have evolve   the development lesson of the Millennium Development Goals and the cumulative experience of the   year of the United Nations should serve as a springboard for our ambition   let we therefore ensure the successful implementation and attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals   sdg    I be confident that the invaluable lesson learn will set we on a trajectory that must inevitably lead to a safe   more inclusive   clean and more prosperous world   in the   year of the existence of the United Nations   the inequality gap among and between nation have continue to widen   as poverty and youth unemployment have threaten the prospect for peace   security and development   my Government look forward to the comprehensive implementation of the   Agenda for Sustainable Development   which promote poverty eradication and the creation of employment opportunity for young people and woman   especially in rural community   over the past   year   the global community have become more united than ever before in its quest to push boundary in order to attain peace and security   yet it be as divide as ever   if not more so   on the question of who make decision on global peace and security   the   year of the existence of the United Nations have see more conflict in Africa than on any other continent   and yet those   year have be characterize by Africa s absolute exclusion from decisionmake in the Security Council   despite the fact that a significant part of the Council s agenda        A   PV   concern the african continent   in the   year of the existence of the United Nations   Africa remain the only continent not represent among the permanent member of the Security Council   Goal   of the   Agenda for Sustainable Development   resolution     on reduce inequality among country will not be achieve without eradicate the inequality among country in the Security Council   the United Nations must   therefore   redouble its effort to implement Security Council reform in order to ensure that Africa can take its rightful place among the community of nation and contribute equitably and effectively to global peace and security   Zambia have continue and will continue to offer its resource for peacekeeping   include the deployment early this year of a large contingent of troop to the Central African Republic   Zambia come with a long history of involvement in conflict prevention   peacekeeping and peacebuilde   as a landlocked country   our independence be incomplete as long as we remained surround by nation still fight their liberation struggle   that give impetus to our moral conviction to join in the liberation struggle in Africa   since then   Zambia have continue to participate in peacebuilde initiative and have support peacekeeping effort all around the world   we continue to share the global concern at the unrelenting threat of terrorism   as it mostly affect the safety of noncombatant and civilian population   I have be encourage by the focus on development that have characterize global discourse during the past year   notably through discussion on the sdg and the   Agenda for Sustainable Development   Zambia have be a beneficiary of various initiative aim at facilitate the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals   which arise from the collective resolve of the generation of world leader at the turn of the millennium   indeed   most of our country have continue to face serious challenge in the quest to foster development and improve the quality of life of our people   the challenge be numerous   include energy shortage and the effect of climate change   the two be inseparable on the development agenda for country such as Zambia that rely heavily on hydropower generation   the change rainfall pattern have adversely affect powergeneration capacity in most of our country   this year   Zambia be experience an unprecedented energy crisis   which have already cost the nation dearly in term of productivity   job and revenue   beyond the economic limitation   the social ramification be equally devastating to the country   it be therefore important that much effort be exert to develop mitigation strategy to counter the effect of climate change   furthermore   develop country be still grapple with other challenge   such as poverty   high unemployment    particularly among the youth    skew industrial development   low intraregional trade   inadequate infrastructure   low productivity in agriculture and livestock   poor quality health service and the challenge of access to quality education   as we move forward   it be important for we to acknowledge the reality and imperative of the world today and to renew our common resolve to sustain the core principle of our Organization as the United Nations   we should redouble our effort   by harness our individual strength in order to collectively address the rather complex challenge that confront we in our increasingly globalized and interdependent world   give the demographic nature of our community   poverty remain a real concern   particularly in rural area   in Zambia    per cent of the people in rural area depend on agriculture for their livelihood   Agriculture be one of my Government s priority area in the county s effort to diversify the economy   apart from mine   the Government be therefore devise intervention aim at improve capacity and add value for both subsistence farmer and commercial farmer   our intervention   notably the Farmer Input Support Programme   the Irrigation Development and Support Project   and other credit scheme   need additional support in order to exploit the full potential of that giant industry   we also seek to strengthen partnership to enable the improvement of service in such area as provide extension service   improve access to market information and facilitate the physical transfer of produce to market   a key element of Zambia s development agenda be industrialization   in that regard   my government have devise measure to encourage and support the development of appropriate industry   mainly in valueadde industry   in order to spur structural economic transformation and increase privatesector participation   the primary focus in that area have be on area with more backward and forward linkage so as to catapult the zambian economy to high level of growth   leverage regional value chain so as to     A   pv      expand trade   attract foreign direct investment   create employment   reduce poverty   promote sustainable development and thereby empower our people   financing be one of the major challenge that face develop country   we need external resource to bridge the gap in the fund require to finance development project   it be in that light that the United Nations third International Conference on Financing for Development   hold in Addis Ababa in July to develop strategy for finance development   be most welcome   the Conference recommend several measure mean to bridge the financing gap   include the need to exploit new source of finance and improve tax administration system   which would be supplement by international support   we know that put the appropriate infrastructure in place be very important in our quest to expand intraafrica trade   bolster our productive capacity and enhance Africa s competitiveness in the global market   in that regard   we must quickly identify source to raise the   billion Africa need annually to finance its infrastructure development   it be equally important   from the perspective of landlocked develop country   to remain committed to implement the decision of the   Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the decade    in keeping with that commitment   Zambia be privileged to host a highlevel meeting on the followup to the Second United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries   hold in Livingstone in June   I be honour to officiate at the conference and hope that the Assembly find the time to review the outcome document   entitle   Livingstone Call for Action    special attention should be pay to gender and woman s empowerment   the International Conference on Population and Development Beyond   Global Review Report   publish in June    indicate that   per cent of woman have be victim of gender base violence   indeed   Zambia acknowledge that the problem extend to most nation   include our own   to that end   we be already implement important intervention to curb that scourge   our approach to development will not be limit to the economy but will continue to focus on all pillar of development   I welcome the fact that our traditional leader   the United Nations system and civil society have all be seamlessly work with government in fighting for gender equality for our woman and girl   one of the most important programme   and one in which I have be engage as a designate champion   be the   he for she   campaign   which seek to address issue of genderbased violence   that project be initiate by UNWomen in September   with the aim of address incident of genderbased violence   in a few day   my Government will also launch the United Statessupported   from boy to Men   project   which target the toyearold age group and be aim at encourage the development of a nonviolent generation   in our determination to bridge the gap between the sexes   a vigorous campaign be under way to strengthen the education of girl by encourage they to complete their schooling and unlock their developmental potential instead of be push into child   early or force marriage   the situation of our young people remain daunt   with unemployment one of the major challenge they face   to address that situation   my Government recently launch a national youth policy that seek to lay a foundation for intervention of various kind aim at support the development of a vibrant and productive generation   we hope to create    job over the next five year   an effort that will depend heavily on the privatesectorled job market   we be also make effort to address the specific social disadvantage of the most marginalized member of our society   include the disabled   we want to ensure that they can realize their potential and serve in national development effort in the same way as anyone else   the challenge be many   but they be not insurmountable   the United Nations have be a key ally in address some of those problem   and indeed   to a large extent   the story of Zambia be the story of the United Nations   I be confident that through our concerted and collective effort   determination and hard work   couple with able and visionary leadership   we shall indeed overcome   I look forward to work with everyone here so as to ensure that our share solution be bring forward and implement in the spirit of this Organization

exploit the value chain from its Godgiven natural resource   and in improve the quality of life of the continent s citizen   the entire world stand to benefit more from an economically empower african continent than from one emasculate by deprivation and with an over dependence on other   Adaptation to change be the most crucial ingredient for the vibrancy and effectiveness of any organization   include the United Nations   while the world have drastically change since    the United Nations   and indeed the global governance architecture   remains mire in a long bygone era   this archaic hierarchy among nation threaten to erode the confidence and support that the United Nations command among the majority   but disadvantaged   of its membership   we be disappointed that we have lose the opportunity of this anniversary to address this burn issue of Security Council reform in a manner that satisfy the just demand and expectation of the majority among we   I wish to reiterate our strong attachment to Africa s common position on Security Council reform contain in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration   I call on all genuine friend of Africa and all those who value

only that of an exclusive   privileged few   respect and uphold human right be the obligation of all state and be enshrine in the United Nations Charter   nowhere do the Charter arrogate the right to some to sit in judgement over other in carry out this universal obligation   in that regard   we reject the politicization of this important issue and the application of double standard to victimize those who dare think and act independently of the selfanointed prefect of our time   we equally reject attempt to prescribe new right that be contrary to our value   norm   tradition and belief   we be not gay   cooperation and respect for each other will advance the cause of human right worldwide   confrontation   vilification and double standard will not   selfdetermination and independence be intrinsic and fundamental right that should be enjoy you all people everywhere   without distinction   we be deeply concerned by the continued denial of this basic right to the Saharan people   we urge the United Nations to expeditiously finalize what must be do to conclude the decolonization of the Western Sahara   in the Middle East   the suffering of the palestinian people continue unabated   what do Mr   Obama say about that   we reiterate our unwavering support for the just cause of the palestinian people   do we agree   Mr   United States   we also reiterate that last peace in the Middle East can be achieve only through negotiation to achieve a twostate solution base on the pre border   we be concern at the increase in tension in that region and urge the United Nations to assume its responsibility and bring an end to this senseless conflict   the promotion of gender equality be critical for the realization of the post development agenda   the African Union have designate   as the Year of Women s Empowerment and Development towards Agenda   in order to mobilize our individual and collective action around this key issue   Gender equality and woman s empowerment be central to the achievement of human development   progress and the elimination of the scourge of poverty and deprivation   we must continue to build upon the achievement that have be realize since the   Fourth World Conference on Women and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action   the grow list of phenomena that neither respect nor know any border make it imperative that we mobilize all mechanism for cooperation to effectively overcome they   Terrorism and extremist violence   communicable disease such as HIV and AIDS   tuberculosis   malaria   bird flu   and Ebola can not be overcome singlehandedly   the United Nations and its specialized agency be the place and the mechanism for this indispensable and necessary cooperation   for some month now   we have watch heartbreaking and harrowing scene of desperate refugee seek to enter Europe in search of safety and shelter from the ravage of conflict in their own homeland   we have also read of the tragedy and loss of life in the Mediterranean   the majority of the affected people be from Syria or from other country devastate by conflict and instability   induce in great part by the destabilizing policy of external force   this tragic situation could have be avoid through respect for the independence of other country and noninterference in their internal affair   in the case of Libya   we be witness the result of abuse the authority of the Security Council and ignore the opinion of regional organization   in this instance the African Union   that be suppose to be the partner of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security   my country   Zimbabwe   be commit to a fair   just and effective United Nations in which multilateralism   inclusivity and transparency replace unilateralism   exclusion and backroom deal   the Charter of the United Nations be build on the bedrock of the sovereign equality and independence of its member   without distinction as to their geographical size   economic might or any other endowment or qualification   we be deeply attach to these principle and call on other member of the United Nations to be similarly dispose   the United Nations be set up   among other purpose   to   develop friendly relation among nation    zimbabwe desire and be commit to nurture friendly relation with other nation   but it can not tolerate interference in its domestic affair   we invite other country with which we may have difference of whatever nature    include the United States and the NATO power    to eschew threat   pressure and punitive action in favour of reconciliation   friendship and dialogue   I therefore denounce in the strong term the illegal sanction that be impose on my country by the European Union and the United States of America and call for their immediate and unconditional removal   we do not know what wrong we have do to the United States   I would kindly ask it to leave we free and independent to do our own thing   once more   I put on record that my country be desirous to live in harmony with all country big and small   we have peace in Zimbabwe just now   we do not want war   we do not want
